(U//FOUO) Introduction to the Korean Issue Management Team
FROM: the Korean Issue Management Team

Run Date: 05/20/2003

(U//FOUO) This past November the SID Director introduced you to the "Issue Manager Team"
construct. In February 2003, the "Korean Issue Management Team" (KIMT) was formed and
consists of members from Customer Relationships 
), Analysis and Production (Fran
Fleish), and Data Acquisition (
). The KIMT is established to identify North Korean
SIGINT gaps, prioritize them, and challenge the enterprise to respond with solutions. The KIMT's
objective is to "bind the bubbles" with the SID Director's authority to leverage people and
resources in a quiet way to get their job done. Our goal is to transform how we do business,
optimize our resources and provide increased value to our customers. Because KIMT's potential
is so great for the Enterprise, we want to keep you updated on our progress.
(S//SI) On 11 March, the KIMT briefed the NSA/CSS Long Term SIGINT Strategy against North
Korea to the 2nd Qtr/FY03 SIGINT Enterprise Quarterly Executive Leadership Conference held at
Fort Belvoir, Virginia. As a result of the brief, the KIMT was tasked to use the six SID Operating
Principles to conduct an analysis of the Priority-1 NK Information Needs (INs). This effort was
completed and briefed to the SID Executive Leadership Board (ELB) on 16 April. The Team is
currently completing an assessment of the Priority-2 NK INs, which combined with the Priority-1
INs, will account for approximately 75% of all NK INs.
(S//SI) A lesson learned from the Iraq IMT was that we are increasingly working intelligence
issues that do not correlate to any one Intelligence Community (IC) organization. Additionally,
we discovered that seamless work across the entire Enterprise is critical to bridging the threatbased and capability-based SIGINT system. To be effective, we must plan meticulously to
produce SIGINT with an unwavering focus for our customer needs. Therefore, the KIMT is
coordinating a Multi-INT Review, with other Intelligence Community partners, to map customer
key decisions/interests on NK, to stated customer INs and then determine which IC Agency has
the lead for each IN. Additionally, the KIMT is planning a series of NK Rock-Drills in the JuneJuly timeframe. The first Rock-Drill will focus on coordinating, at the working level, short and
mid-term cryptologic planning activities on NK. This effort will include organizations throughout
the Enterprise, to include Service Cryptologic Elements (SCE's), key customers and other IC
partners. The second Drill will facilitate senior-level discussions on the Multi-INT Review and a
wrap-up of the first NK Rock-Drill.
(S//SI) We expect the results of these activities to optimize our overall capability against NK,
providing the best possible SIGINT support to our customers. This effort is all about integrated
planning and disciplined execution across the Enterprise. You'll be hearing more about the MulitINT Review and NK Rock Drills so stay tuned!
