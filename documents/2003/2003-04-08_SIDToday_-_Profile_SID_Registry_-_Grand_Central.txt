(U) Profile: SID Registry - Grand Central
FROM:
Chief, SID Registry
Run Date: 04/08/2003

(U//FOUO) The Signals Intelligence Directorate gets a lot of mail.
 SERIES: 
Some are "Thank you" notes from customers, some are "Requests
(U) Communications and
for Information" and some are "Let's coordinate on this." SID also
Support Operations
sends a lot of mail: notes to the Director, correspondence to other
(CSO)
directorates, correspondence to Congress, to name just a very few.
(U//FOUO) How to keep track of it all? Across the hall from the SID
Director's office you will find the SID Registry. Like a railroadswitching station (and equally atmospheric), Registry makes sure
that correspondence (called "packages") going into/out of SID is
handled efficiently. Does this package get the express treatment,
or the scenic route? Which track should it be sent down-should it
go to Data Acquisition, or maybe the SID Chief of Staff, or
someone else? Registry also monitors responses going out,
keeping a timetable to ensure a prompt reply. We also have
personnel integrated into SID/Customer Relationships, Analysis &
Production and Data Acquisition to help keep the packages moving.
(U//FOUO) ...but there is more to the job than pulling levers.
Registry also tries to provide "value-added" service whenever
possible. We perform quality control, make sure Agency guidelines
are followed, and help offices format or edit correspondence, as
needed. Registry also generates correspondence on behalf of SID
(with guidance, of course, from senior management).

(U//FOUO) Much of Registry's work is invisible to the general SID
workforce-but if the system runs smoothly and there are no
derailments, we've done our job! For more information about SID
