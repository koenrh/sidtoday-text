(U) SID Hiring (part 1: Outlook)

FROM: Maria Magoulas—Perkins
Chief, SIGINT People Office
Run Date: 04/29/2003

    

§\

(U//FOUO) We are fortunate that with a Congressional supplemental, SID will hire more than
500 people this year and will likely have comparable hiring programs in the years to come. The
SIGINT People Office wants to remind all SID hiring managers to continue moving full steam
ahead to keep the hiring pipeline filled with the most qualified applicants. It is imperative that
we keep working to satisfy our hiring requisitions. This includes bringing in applicants,
conducting interviews, extending offers, and providing candidates with security forms in order to
get them through the necessary processing.

(U//FOUO) Currently SID hiring is focused strongly on the ongoing campaigns. However, per
agreement between the SID Chief of Staff and Chief HRS, and per previous guidance from Chief
HRS to continue to hire qualified applicants, please ensure that applicants are not being turned
away because of hiring allocations (or lack thereof), but only because they do not have the
requisite skills for the job you have to fill. No one should be turned away because of lack of
billets/hiring allocations, etc.

(U//FOUO) As a SID hiring manager, when/if you are faced with this situation, please advise
your respective hiring authority of your requirement(s) and they will coordinate with the SIGINT
People Office. The SIGINT People Office will raise the issue to the SID Chief of Staff for
resolution. The list of SID hiring authorities can be found here.

(U) Coming in part 2 of this message: Welcoming New Hires
