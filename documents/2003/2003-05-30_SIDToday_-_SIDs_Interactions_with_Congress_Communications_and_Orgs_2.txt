(U) How Does SID LA Work With NSA's LAO?

(U//FOUO) SID LA provides congressional staffers and committees
with appropriate SIGINT—related information and briefings and
develop the SID Congressional Engagement Strategy for inclusion
into the overall NSA Engagement Strategy. The office is not
forward—deployed from NSA LAO, but is actually assigned to SID
and staffed by SIGINTers. It is structured similarly to NSA LAO in
that SID LA has separate "account managers" for the involved
congressional committees. Office personnel usually attend SID
briefings to the congressional staffs and committees and provide
feedback on these sessions to SID leadership. They can then
provide background information as to the tone and conteXt
surrounding follow—on queries from Congress.

(U//FOUO) For further information on how NSA LAO interacts with
Congress, see their web page at "go lao".
