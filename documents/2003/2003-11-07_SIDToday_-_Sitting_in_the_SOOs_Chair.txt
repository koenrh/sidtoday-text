(U//FOUO) There are many advantages to this position. The
primary one is that when your 8-hour shift is up you can go home,
comfortable and assured that someone else has taken the "con"
and is doing the job as well or better than you. There is no need to
hang around for an extra 2 or 3 hours to make sure something
gets taken to closure. The second advantage that comes to mind is
the camaraderie. A bond like no other develops between co-

workers on shift work and besides, we have the best pig-ins! Also
being exposed to NSA's successes every day inspires an even
greater sense of pride and accomplishment. It is truly a unique and
awe-inspiring circumstance.
