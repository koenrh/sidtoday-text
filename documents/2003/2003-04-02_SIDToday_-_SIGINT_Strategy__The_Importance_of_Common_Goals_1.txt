(U//FOUO) One of the most essential tools for integrating organizations and

functions is a common set of goals and objectives. Just as I've talked about

how important it is for all of us on "team SIGINT" to "play position" (See
related Slihdii Nessa e and recent 53.5)!) Messaoe of the la 1 ), it's equally imperative that we
have an overall game plan—— so we all know where we're headed and can play our positions
accordingly. The SIGINT strategy—— AKA the SID Placemat—— is that game plan. The latest update
of our strategy, the SIGINT Enterprise Strategy: FY 2003—2008, is now available on the SIGINT

(Ii

(U//FOUO) Please take the time to read the SIGINT Enterprise Strategy: FY 2003—2008 today.
Every one of us is integral to the success of the SIGINT system; ideally, everyone in SID will see
themselves in this strategy. We all own the strategy, the goals it sets forth, and its outcomes.
Remember, as you read it, that the strategy only sets a course for the future. It's in pursuing
our goals that we learn and discover—— changing, improving, and stressing the strategy along the
way. It's not what the strategy says so much as it is what it causes to happen in the hands of
brilliant people. Here's to discovery! (U//FOUO) Since the inception of the SID organization over
two years ago, we also have worked to develop measures to assess our progress against our
strategy. I will be working with the SIGINT Leadership Team to review our progress against the
SIGINT strategy regularly. The results of our performance reviews will be available via SIGINT
Directorate Homepage. Having all of our efforts aligned by mapping our P3s to the strategy will
help to assess our overall performance. In addition to aligning your own P3 objectives with the
plan, many of you also will be contributing performance measurement data for the SIGINT
Performance Reviews. I appreciate your commitment to "inspecting what we expect."
