(U) P3 Note to the SID Workforce
FROM:
SID Workforce Performance Management Executive
Run Date: 06/10/2003

(U) Short Summary
(U//FOUO) All SID personnel are to have a P3 by 1 August. SID managers and employees must
work together to develop the P3. Please note that managers have additional, mandatory
objectives for their P3s. All P3s are to be sent to
, 
@nsa. Details follow:
(U//FOUO) Submit Copies of Your P3
(U//FOUO) The 2003 performance management cycle for P3s runs from 1 January 2003 to 31
December 2003. Your performance plan establishes what is expected of you in your job. It is a
collaborative process and not one that you should do yourself. If you do not have a P3 with
stated objectives for this calendar year, you need to talk to your immediate supervisor and
establish one as soon as possible. As you know, the Chief of Staff for SID, at the Town Meeting
on 25 April, promised we would hold managers accountable for P3s for their employees.
(U//FOUO) We would like to have a P3 on file for every civilian in SID by 1 August 2003 . To do
this, we ask you--all SID employees-- to send a copy of your P3 to our Workforce Performance
Management Executive, 
 You can do this via email using
nsa and a
subject line of, P3:your name; or via Agency mail to
, Ops 5A172,
. For
those of you who have already developed your P3s, we would ask you to take a minute and
please send it to 
. For those of you who do not yet have P3s, take some time soon to
meet with your supervisor and begin the process as soon as possible.
(U//FOUO) For SID Managers:
(U//FOUO) You may have seen the message from the SIGINT Director to SID Seniors on
performance objectives . Seniors were asked to include some mandatory objectives; all SID
managers are also asked to incorporate the objective regarding the performance management
process into their P3s. If applicable, you are asked also to include the objective on property
accountability. Therefore,
For every SID manager, please add:
"Institutionalize the performance management process and ensure that all personnel receive
honest, useful, and timely feedback."
For every SID manager whose organization owns one or more piece of equipment, please add: 
"Improve the Agency's property accountability posture. During CY03, ensure 99%
accountability of the total assets and value of all accountable property within your organization
as reported in DPAS, to include tracking, receiving, shipping, relocating, and all changes due to
reorganizations, etc., of all accountable equipment, recording all within 5 days of the
transaction." (See here for more information on Property Accountability.)
(U//FOUO) If you have any questions, please contact
