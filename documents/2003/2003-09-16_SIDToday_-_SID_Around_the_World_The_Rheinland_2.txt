(U) As for cuisine, eating in Germany can be a real pleasure for all
but the most conservative tastes. I have not had a bad German
meal yet. Local specialties abound; in the Rhein/Main plain closer
to Darmstadt, the Germans grow the sweet, white asparagus
("Spargel") that is harvested in May and enjoyed throughout
Germany. The strawberry season follows immediately thereafter.

(U//FOUO) It might belabor the obvious that I enjoyed living in
Germany to no end. Working and living in the field is a great
experience, and working at ETC and living in Germany was no
exception. I'd do it again.
