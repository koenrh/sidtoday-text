(U//FOUO) Conference on Organized Crime Held This Week
FROM:
SINIO for International Crime and Narcotics
Run Date: 05/23/2003

(U//FOUO) In recent years, there has been increase in cross-border criminal activities, including
trafficking in drugs, people, weapons, as well as in the laundering of the proceeds. On May 19th,
the SINIO for Crime and Narcotics, in concert with the International Crime and Narcotics product
line, sponsored a conference on International Organized Crime: The Threat to U.S. National
Security and The Challenge of Global Organized Crime . This conference examined the
transnational criminal organizations that engage in these activities, as well as the threats posed
to U.S. security.
(U//FOUO) Mr. Bill Black, NSA Deputy Director, commenced the conference, and introduced
keynote speaker Grant Ashley, Assistant Director, FBI Criminal Investigations. Experts from both
academia and the Intelligence and Law Enforcement Communities provided briefings on:
the U.S. position in defending the homeland against organized crime syndicates;
the nexus of organized crime, terrorism and drugs;
the economic threat to U.S. national security from organized crime and money
laundering;
exploring money laundering vulnerabilities;
global organized crime and the threat to critical infrastructures; and
Russian organized crime.
(U//FOUO) Providing the NSA workforce with strategic information from experts working these
issues outside of the Intelligence Community is a critical approach in keeping fresh and
expanding for our analysts the global understanding and integration of these national security
topics, serving as a critical enabler in educating and leading the workforce to meet the needs
and priorities of the future, and providing a big picture scope with which to guide and reinforce
our internal efforts on the organized crime target.
(U//FOUO) Most unique about this particular conference, which is one in a series, was that for
the first time, our community customers were invited to attend, providing both audience
diversity and a unique opportunity for networking between academia, the Intelligence
Community, and Law Enforcement. Participants included attendees from MRSOC, Drug
Enforcement Administration, State Department, CIA, Justice Department, FBI, and Canada's
Communications Security Establishment (CSE).
