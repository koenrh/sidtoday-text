(U) So what are your plans for Memorial Day? By all means enjoy your picnics and backyard
barbeque, the parades and baseball games or time with family and friends. But please also
remember to take time to reflect on the true meaning of Memorial Day. Something as simple as
observing the National Moment of Remembrance at 15:00 local time...a chance for all Americans
to pay tribute to those who placed country before self and paid the ultimate sacrifice for our
freedom. We owe them a debt of honor and gratitude.
