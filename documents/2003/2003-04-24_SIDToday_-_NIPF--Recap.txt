(U//FOUO) NIPF--Recap
FROM:
NSA Representative to NIPF Working Group
Run Date: 04/24/2003

(U) Yesterday, Mark Roth from the office of the Assistant Director for Central Intelligence for
Analysis and Production (ADCI/AP) provided an introductory briefing to SID on the National
Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF).
(U) Both informative and educational, the presentation clearly outlined the overhauled
intelligence priority process, and also included a very beneficial Q & A session with SID leaders
involved in the new process. Several questions were addressed regarding the effects NIPF will
have on the workforce, including the timeline for implementation, the flexibility of the system,
and the relation to NSRP to name a few. For the further information on NIPF, the briefing slides,
and for answers to frequently asked questions, please visit the Strategic Intelligence Issues
website.
