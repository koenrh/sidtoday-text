(S//SI) Information Needs Management: Careful Planning Aids
SIGINT Response to Iraq War
FROM:
Acting Chief, Customer Gateway
Run Date: 04/17/2003
(S//SI) The months of advanced warning which we received prior
to the onset of war in Iraq allowed the Customer Relationships
Directorate (CRD) to help NSA to understand customers'
Information Needs (INs) like never before. The benefits both to
NSA and to customers are clear. Customers are confident that NSA
knows what information they need and that it is working to provide
that information. NSA, in turn, has had a reasonably stable list of
validated, comprehensive, coherent INs against which to focus the
efforts of its people and equipment.
(S//SI) Since the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom, NSA has
not experienced the flood of customer requests for information that
was feared. This is an example of planning which succeeds in a
time of crisis. For example, since March 17th, a few days before
the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom, we have received only
29 new or modified Information Needs in the National SIGINT
Requirements Process (NSRP). The 24/7 watch desks, which were
stood up for the Campaign, proved able to manage this volume. By
contrast, during the first two weeks following the attacks of 11
September 2001, NSOC was flooded with nearly 300 requests for
information; and by the end of 2001, this number had skyrocketed
to nearly 1700.
(S//SI) How did this improvement come about? The success
resulted from a lot of hard work and determination on the part of
multiple elements of SID, the Extended Enterprise, and the
Intelligence Community. Leadership from senior SID and CRD
managers provided the key transformational initiative. Three
initiatives came together to provide for a successful outcome:
A group of representatives from all the intelligence
disciplines (SIGINT, IMINT, HUMINT, MASINT, OSINT)
worked for months last autumn to gather, synthesize, and
most importantly, map Information Needs to government
leadership and military commanders' key decision points.
The NSRP system came on-line in mid-summer and was
declared operational in early 2003, bringing with it the
Customer Information Needs Desk on the NSOC floor.
The CRD opened the Requirements Analysis Center (RAC) in
late 2002 to manage and adjust the focus of the SIGINT
System on the specific INs of the most interest to our
customers at any given moment in time.
(S//SI) By the end of January, the integrated list of SIGINT
Information Needs had been entered into NSRP. Since that time,
an intensive effort has continued to keep this list up-to-date and to
remain closely coupled with the customers' battle rhythm to ensure
that we are focusing on the most important needs and are
delivering the intelligence that counts in time to make a difference.
