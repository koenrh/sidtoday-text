(U//FOUO) The compilation of the CBJB is a major project.
Personnel from NSA's DF3 (Program and Budget Build) coordinate
with SID budget managers to gather together cost figures and
justifications for every program across the directorate and present
the data in a consistent format for the congressional committees.
The CBJB is due to the committees on the first Monday in
February. The recently completed Fiscal Year 2004 CBJB totaled
761 pages, and took 5 months to assemble.
