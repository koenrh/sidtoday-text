RE“ W (U) SID Around the WW”: WaShington, D.c.

Chief, CSG Joint Staff

(C//SI) Sometimes a field assignment does not require a major
move. Having already had five overseas assignments, my wife and
Ijust couldn't face packing up and moving yet again. So I found a
"local" assignment in Arlington, VA. CSG Joint Staff is located in
the Pentagon, providing SIGINT support to the Chairman, Joint
Chiefs of Staff, the J—2 (Directorate for Intelligence), and the Joint
Staff. CSG Joint Staff members find themselves in the middle of
nearly every crisis situation that comes into the Pentagon because
SIGINT usually provides the bulk of the information related to
those events.

(U) The daily commute to the Pentagon, while longer than my
commute to Fort Meade, is really not so difficult due to our shift
schedule, and parking is no worse than what we have at NSA.
Inside the building, however, is another story. The Pentagon is like
a museum with a variety of displays throughout the building. Just
inside the river entrance is an outstanding display on the life and
career of President Eisenhower. Other displays include the career
of General Omar Bradley, NATO, ANZUS, the USO, and D—Day.
There is also a small chapel with a memorial to the Pentagon
victims of September 11.

(U) What's so exciting about being here? Well, we often see issues
we've worked on being discussed later on TV by the Secretary of
Defense. And like Forrest Gump, I occasionallyjust happen to
show up in areas where big—name people are passing by, such as
Gen. Tommy Franks and (gasp!) Brit Hume. But the most exciting
part of the job is working under a tight deadline to provide
intelligence that is needed "right now or sooner" by primary
customers who will put it to use. This sense of urgency, coupled
with the face—to—face contact with our customers, makes for a true
feeling of job satisfaction.
