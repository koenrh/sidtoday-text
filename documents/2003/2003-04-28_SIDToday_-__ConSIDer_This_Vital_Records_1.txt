(C) Did you know that copies of NSA's most vital records are being stored in Sugar Grove, West
Virginia?

(U) The Vital Records Program ensures that copies of NSA's most important documents are kept
in a safe location away from Fort Meade. Why?—— So that if a natural disaster, fire, attack, etc.
should destroy the originals at NSA, we will still be able to access a backup copy. The program
began in 1952 when President Truman signed an executive order making each federal
department and agency responsible for carrying out its essential functions in an emergency;
later Presidents have issued modifications.

(U//FOUO) If you think you may have vital records, see Vital Records FAQ for definitions and

instructions on how to preserve them.
