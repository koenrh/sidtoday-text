(U/FOUO) As the Technical Leader for Analysis & Production
(A&P;), my main concern is transformation of analysis, mission,
technology, and technical leadership. I ask myself on a weekly-- if
not daily-- basis, "Is A&P; moving forward in these areas?" In
analysis, I would like to see progress in implementing many of the
ideas outlined in Richard Heuer's seminal work, The Psychology of
Intelligence Analysis . I believe this book should be required
reading for all A&P; analysts because it so clearly lays out methods
for improving analysis and avoiding analytic pitfalls. As I look back
at some of the analytic work I did years ago, I see some of the
problems I had then with mindset, biases, and perception. Had I
known about many of the self-help steps described in this book, I
believe my work would have been even better.
(C) In mission and technology, my primary concern continues to be
making progress in Digital Network Intelligence (DNI). Voice
dominates our reporting today, yet DNI is much more prolific in the
global net. There are many reasons why DNI reporting has not
increased dramatically over the years: problems with access,
cultural proclivities, and the difficulty in working DNI. All of these
vie for my attention right now, and I feel confident that we can
provide analysts better access and tools in the near future.
(U/FOUO) Finally, building more technical leaders is essential. The
model of the new working relationship between senior
management and technical leaders was set at the creation of the
SIGINT Directorate. Great progress has been made in this regard
and will continue as technical experts supplement their knowledge
with an understanding of many basic SID processes such as
requirements, systems engineering, and programmatics.
