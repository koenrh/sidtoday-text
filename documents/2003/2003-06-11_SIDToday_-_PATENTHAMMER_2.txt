(S) NTIO Teams With KRSOC/What the Future Holds/For More Information

(S//SI) The NTIO is working with the Kunia Regional Security Operations Center (KRSOC) on a
Joint Chiefs of Staff Special Projects Exercise to provide a similar NTI proof—of—concept capability
for reach—forward/reach—back operations in the Pacific. Assuming operations at GRSOC and
KSROC are successful, the next step will be to include this type of functionality as part of SID's
future Radio Frequency (RF) strategy for HF/UHF/VHF collection. The SIGINT capability of these
new advanced digital software radios can satisfy both National and Tactical SIGINT requirements

and has the potential to fill major gaps in the RF collection environment.
