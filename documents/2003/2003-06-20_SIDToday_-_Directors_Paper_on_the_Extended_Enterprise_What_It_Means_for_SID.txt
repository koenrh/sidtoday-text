(U//FOUO) Director's Paper on the Extended Enterprise: What It
Means for SID
FROM: SIGINT Communications
Unknown
Run Dates: 06/20/2003 , 06/21/2003 , 06/22/2003
(U//FOUO) As noted in a recent Agency-all email , Director Hayden has issued a paper entitled
"The Extended Enterprise: Where To From Here?" . This paper changes the relationship between
NSA's headquarters and field elements, and has a direct impact on how SID operates. Although
we recommend you read the entire paper (it's nine pages, but an easy read) for the full story,
we've excerpted below some of these key points that relate to SID:
(U) MISSION 
(U//FOUO) The paper restates that "All SIGINT and related activities are under the direct
operational control of the Director of SID or his designated representative... In short,
headquarters elements will exercise operational control of their activity wherever it is found
across the enterprise. This control includes guidance, tasking, prioritization, and resource
allocation as well as the setting of policy, mission standards and performance metrics."
(U) COMMAND
(U//FOUO) "None of the above removes the responsibility of a field chief or a site commander
to act as a chief or commander. Headquarters elements exercise operational control of mission
in the extended enterprise through the chiefs and commanders . We will have centralized
direction, but we must also have decentralized execution."
(U) GOVERNANCE: WRIT LARGE
(U//FOUO) "...each headquarters mission area will be responsible - working through the chiefs
and commanders - for control of its respective activity on site. However, the mission activity
constituting the dominant activity at each site will have overall responsibility for site support and
performance. Accordingly, extended enterprise leaders will link directly to the following
headquarters mission elements:
Liaison offices, activities, and representatives performing predominantly foreign liaison FAD
CSGs [Cryptologic Services Groups]

SID/S1

RSOCs and MOC [Regional Security Operations Centers and the Meade Operations
Center]

SID/S2

Collection Sites; European and Pacific Technical Centers

SID/S3

(U//FOUO) "The NCRs [National Cryptologic Representatives] at Defense, State, Homeland
Security, and the Combatant Commands, and our representatives to our major Intelligence
Community partners do not fit entirely comfortably into the fighting forces paradigm -- they
function as our diplomatic corps as well. While responding to tasking from the mission areas,
these representatives will continue to report to me, with admin support from the Chief of Staff." 
(U//FOUO) "NSA headquarters offices will make any organizational changes they need to make
to handle this new function. FAD is pretty far along in managing liaison offices but S2 will
probably need some work to adequately govern Medina, Gordon, Kunia, and Meade . I want S2
to think about and treat the RSOCs and MOC just the way they now deal with headquartersbased product lines. And I want the dialogue between them to be as immediate and as intense.
The same applies to S3 -- plugged in to field sites as tightly as they are to TAO . S1 may have
less to do if we can tie the SEAMS closely to our customer footprints (CSGs)."
(U) MANPOWER

(U) "All of this demands some fundamental changes in the way we handle manpower issues in
a distributed enterprise. Simply put, SID and IAD will be responsible for operational billets
wherever they are located. ... All extended enterprise billets will be the responsibility of one or
another headquarters element."
