(TS//SI) MG Quirk led a trip to Baghdad, Iraq in mid-November to meet with our customers and
partners as well as our deployed personnel. The group met NCR CENTCOM, Greg Smithberger, in
Qatar and then travelled to Baghdad, where they met with CJTF-7 intel units including the CJTF7 Intel Fusion Center, CSG Baghdad, and the Coalition J2 or C2 Brigadier General (P) Barb Fast.
Other stops included TF-121, the Iraq Survey Group - Baghdad, SCS Baghdad, Coalition
Provisional Authority, tactical SIGINT units, the 1st Armored Division, and Abu Ghurayb Prison.

 Iraq Issue Manager; Dr. Eric
Haseltine, NSA/Associate Director for Research; Greg Smithberger, NCR CENTCOM; and MG
Quirk, SIGINT Director, in Qatar as they prepare to visit Baghdad, Iraq.
 
The trip from Qatar to Iraq in a C-130 comes with all the expected modern travel conveniences:
a web seat and ear plugs.
 
MG Quirk gains insight into the deteriorating weather conditions from the pilot of the C-130 (the
flight out was provided by a unit from the Kentucky National Guard).
The group was met by

 
, NCR Iraq, (far left) upon arriving at the Baghdad
International Airport.

 
Living quarters were provided at this villa at Saddam's Presidential Palace North at CAMP
VICTORY, home to CJTF-7 HQ, near Baghdad International Airport.
 
SID has analysts deployed here, at the Iraq Survey Group (ISG) HQ in Camp SLAYER, within
another of Saddam's palace complexes. The primary mission for the ISG is the search for
weapons of mass destruction (WMD).
 
For travel outside the the protected zones, helmets, armored vests, and weaponry are
expected.
 
 
The Coalition Provisional Authority Palace, aka Saddam's former presidential palace, located in
central Baghdad on the banks of the Tigris River. Here the group met with NCR Iraq staff.
 
The group also met with Ambassador McManaway, then deputy to Ambassador Bremer, the
head of the Coalition Provisional Authority. During the visit, the group passed through the
palace's chapel, shown here. Note the mural on the far end depicting Scud missiles rising to the
heavens.
 

One of the highlights of the trip was an opportunity to visit tactical SIGINT units. The 501st
Battalion set up their SIGINT collection system here, at the Four Heads Palace in Baghdad.
 
MG Quirk posed with members of the 501st Battalion of the 1st Armored Division at the Four
Heads Palace in Baghdad. The group was able to discuss national to tactical integration and
SIGINT support from the tactical SIGINTer's perspective.

The warfighter's precision munitions may make a small hole to start...
 
...but they bring quite a bit of destruction (inside the Four Heads Palace, home to the 501st).
 
At Abu Ghurayb prison, the group discussed the role of interrrogations and how they can provide
leads for SIGINT. They also visited one of Saddam's torture chambers.
