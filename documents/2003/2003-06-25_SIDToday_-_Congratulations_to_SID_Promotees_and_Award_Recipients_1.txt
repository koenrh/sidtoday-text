(U//FOUO) It is our great pleasure to recognize this year's SID civilian promotees. The official
promotion list will be forthcoming soon, pending notification of all recipients. These individuals
selected for advancement have made outstanding contributions to SID and the Agency, and
have played a major role in the great successes we have achieved over the past year. Given the
tremendous talent resident in the SID workforce, it is no easy feat to be singled out for such
recognition! We, the SID Leadership Team, heartily congratulate the promotees and look
forward to even greater things from them in future.

(U//FOUO) As you know, this year we also committed a large portion of our remaining awards
money for the promotion cycle towards Quality Step Increases (QSI), Sustained Superior Work
Performance (SSWP), and Special Achievement Awards (SAA), to reward outstanding performers
for their contributions. Additionally, we take particular pride in the number of Team Awards
which were allocated, since so much of our work depends upon group efforts. The competition
for these SID awards was likewise very steep, and we highly commend the outstanding
accomplishments of each and every recipient.

(U//FOUO) We are well aware that the SID workforce is the very foundation of SID's success. As
a result, our goal is to reward appropriately, within our monetary constraints, all who perform
with excellence. We realize that not all who are deserving have received recognition, but we are
committed to rewarding outstanding performance to the fullest extent possible.

(U) Please join us in congratulating SID's honorees—— they've done a fantastic job!
