(U//FOUO) The Crypto—Mathematics Institute (CMI) is the oldest of
the Learned Organizations at NSA. It was established by Lieutenant
General John A. Samford, Director, NSA, in a memorandum dated
October 1957. The CMI has been an integral part of the
mathematics community at NSA ever since its inception.

(U//FOUO) The purpose of the Institute is to promote those 1'

aspects of mathematics which pertain to cryptology and to provide

a focal point for the NSA mathematics community in fields of 2

common interest. To foster a sense of community as well as 3:

technical excellence, CMI sponsors a variety of social and scholarly

events, including a newsletter, monthly seminars, pizza parties for 4

new hires, and a classified mathematics conference called '

MATHFEST ( see relate-3‘ article in today's NSA Daily ). 5' The Crypto—

(U//FOUO) The Institute celebrates the end of each academic year
with the CMI awards banquet, a social event centered around the
presentation of the new Distinguished Members, the CMI
President's Award, and the CMI Teaching Award, and the essay
contest winners:

 

o (U//FOUO) CMI Distiguished Members are inducted
every year from retirees in the extended mathematics
community, including IDA (the Institute for Defense
Analyses) and Second Parties. This Cryptomath Hall of Fame
currently features 93 members.

0 (U//FOUO) The CMI President's Award (mathematician of
the year), established in 1978, recognizes Agency personnel
who are making important contributions to the mission of
the cryptologic community through the development and
application of the science of mathematical cryptology.

o (U//FOUO) The Crypto—Mathematics Institute has also
presented the CMI Teacher's Award at its annual banquet
since 1997, to honor important teaching contributions to
the mathematics community.

0 (U//FOUO) Since 1959, the Crypto—Mathematics Institute
has sponsored an annual Essay Contest to recognize
outstanding written contributions to the fields of
mathematics and cryptology. Research papers are judged
on their contributions to the general theory of
cryptomathematics or cryptology, while applications papers
should offer innovative uses of cryptomathematical
techniques to solve specific problems.
