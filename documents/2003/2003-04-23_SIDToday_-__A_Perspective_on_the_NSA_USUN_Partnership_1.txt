(S//SI) When the various components of the Signals Intelligence

Directorate and the Extended Enterprise work together in a spirit of

cooperation, communication, and mutual respect, a great
partnership develops which enhances NSA's production support to
its SIGINT customers. Nothing illustrates this better than the U.S.
United Nations (USUN) team which, from the outset, worked
tirelessly to strengthen the ties between NSA and USUN.

(S//SI) SIGINT support to USUN's diplomatic efforts concerning
Iraq has been exceptional. Timely SIGINT played a critical role in
the unanimous adoption of UN Security Council Resolutions 1441
(strengthened the inspection regime and demanded Iraq disarm or
face serious consequences) and 1472 (revised the humanitarian
aid program for Iraq). During that period, the overall volume of
SIGINT supplied to USUN doubled, and the number of timely
SIGINT tippers delivered to USUN players during key points in the
negotiations increased by a factor of four. It was this effort that
prompted Ambassador Negroponte to thank NSA for its work and
to offer this unsolicited comment: "I can't imagine better
intelligence support for a diplomatic mission."

(S//SI) The enterprise—level relationships built by our partnerships
have matured from being transactional to relational in nature.
Instead of working toward customer satisfaction of individual
requirements, these components have developed a degree of
understanding of their customers' needs that promotes positive
outcomes on an even broader scale. The USUN Customer Support
Team worked hard to bring producers and customers closer
together to increase understanding between the USUN

ambassadors and political officers and NSA analysts and producers.

They are only a small part of a much larger team of collectors,
processors, enablers and analyst/reporters, whose outstanding
collective efforts often elicit admiration and praise from USUN
customers. High—quality, timely reporting, precisely tailored to the
customer's needs, has been key for USUN customer satisfaction;
and the people behind the service have made the difference.

(S//SI) A SID Coin was awarded to the SEAM team of

- (SEAM),q (Account Manager), (NSA
Representative to USUN , and? (SINIO or Global
and Multilateral Issues) on 20 Marc 2003, in recognition of their
effective customer support to USUN.
