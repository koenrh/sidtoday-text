(U) The Comms Team Runs with the Pack!
FROM: SIGINT Communications
Unknown
Run Date: 05/16/2003

(U) Three individuals in SIGINT Communications enjoyed participating in Armed Forces Week.
They were 3 of the over 400 runners who came out to run the Armed Forces 5K. The 3.2 mile
course weaved in and out of the paved roads and parking lots surrounding the OPS buildings. All
of the participants were met with cheers and smiles at the end of course...not to mention snacks
and T-shirts! If you weren't one of the 400 this year, plan to be one next year!
