(U) The KRYPTOS Society
FROM:
KRYPTOS Society President
Run Date: 05/09/2003

(U//FOUO) The KRYPTOS Society was established in 1981 to
promote interest in cryptanalysis, to provide a focal point for the
fields of common interest to cryptanalysts of the National Security
Agency, and to promote excellence in the cryptologic community.
KRYPTOS has since expanded to all Second Parties with chapters at
GCHQ, CSE and DSD, which has members from GCSB as well.
(U//FOUO) KRYPTOS schedules monthly technical talks in the
Friedman Auditorium. KRYPTOS sponsors several activities to
recognize cryptanalytic excellence: Cryptanalytic Literature
Competition, Cryptanalytic Talk Competition, Norman Roberts
Award to recognize outstanding junior analysts, Peter Jenks
Community Service Award, and selection of Distinguished Members
from the retired cryptanalytic community. These awards are
presented at an annual fall luncheon.
(U//FOUO) Although NSA's KRYPTOS has an elected council of 8
members from the community, all of these KRYPTOS activities
would not be possible without volunteers from the membership. Of
approximately 250 members, 25% have signed up as volunteers.
