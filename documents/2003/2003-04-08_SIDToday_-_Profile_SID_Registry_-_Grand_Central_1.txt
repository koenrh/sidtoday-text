(U) Profile: SID Registry - Grand Central

FROM:
Chief, SID Registry
Run Date: 04/08/2003

 

§\

(U//FOUO) The Signals Intelligence Directorate gets a lot of mail.
Some are "Thank you" notes from customers, some are "Requests
for Information" and some are "Let's coordinate on this." SID also
sends a lot of mail: notes to the Director, correspondence to other
directorates, correspondence to Congress, to name just a very few.

§§ SERIES:
(U) Communications and
Support Operations
(CSO)

(U//FOUO) How to keep track of it all? Across the hall from the SID 1
Director's office you will find the SID Registry. Like a railroad— '
switching station (and equally atmospheric), Registry makes sure

 

that correspondence (called "packages") going into/out of SID is 2' Profile: SID Registry
handled efficiently. Does this package get the express treatment, _ Grand Central

or the scenic route? Which track should it be sent down—should it 3' Profile: SIGINT

go to Data Acquisition, or maybe the SID Chief of Staff, or Ms
someone else? Registry also monitors responses going out, 4 ' "
keeping a timetable to ensure a prompt reply. We also have '

personnel integrated into SID/Customer Relationships, Analysis & 5

Production and Data Acquisition to help keep the packages moving. 6:

 

(U//FOUO) ...but there is more to the job than pulling levers.
Registry also tries to provide "value—added" service whenever
possible. We perform quality control, make sure Agency guidelines
are followed, and help offices format or edit correspondence, as
needed. Registry also generates correspondence on behalf of SID
(with guidance, of course, from senior management).

(U//FOUO) Much of Registry's work is invisible to the general SID
workforce—but if the system runs smoothly and there are no
derailments, we've done our job! For more information about SID
Registry's missions and functions, services, and team members,
