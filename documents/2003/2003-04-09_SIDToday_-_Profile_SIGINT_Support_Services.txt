(U//FOUO) One of the essential "behind the scenes" SID staff
elements that keeps the directorate running smoothly is the
SIGINT Support Services office. It is this office, for example, that
accounts for all SID-owned property by conducting periodic
inventories and maintaining accurate records. To give you an idea
of the scope of this effort, SID owns more than 34,000 pieces of
equipment!
(U//FOUO) SID/Support also plays an important role in providing
travel services, such as TDY support. This includes assisting
travelers with maintaining their government travel credit card
account while on extended TDY.
(U//FOUO) In addition, the organization serves as SID's point of
contact with other NSA support services, such as OHESS, COMSEC,
and the Management Control Program. SID/Support also acts as
liaison to the NSA Advisory Board, a body that meets quarterly to
advise the Director/NSA on SIGINT, science, technology,
management, and other issues.
