1% I W (U//FOU0) The SID Leadership offsite

FROM:

\ e

(U//FOUO) Maintaining a strong focus on tightening the bonds of the SIGINT Directorate
Leadership Team, MG Quirk led the next step toward SID Enterprise integration during the
group's second offsite held early this week. "We need to optimize the current SID strategy and
structure through full integration," stated MG Quirk as he opened the session. The newly
appointed leadership team then took advantage of the opportunity to further their team
cohesiveness by performing a thorough analysis of SID's mission through a collective look at
SID's roles and responsibilities.

(U//FOUO) An atmosphere of close collaboration and honest communication was evident
throughout the 2—day session as the process of reviewing SID's mission authorities led to frank
discussions of pressing SID issues. Two vital concerns repeatedly expressed were the need for
teamwork to resonate throughout the organization, and the importance of aligning ourselves as
corporate citizens. In other words, good, productive working relationships are necessary at all
levels within SID, with our Extended Enterprise, and with our corporate enablers.

(U) A continuing theme with this leadership team is to decentralize decision—making. One of their
goals is establishing a leadership style that "...removes the obstacles and gets out of the way to
let the people do their work." One important decision made was not to reorganize—the focus is

on honing the present organization into a more efficient contributor to America's security.

(U//FOUO) While there were no specific deliverables from this meeting, additional SID
Leadership sessions will be scheduled in the near future to continue the momentum begun in
the first two off—sites. To learn about the first off—site, go to

expan ing t e ro es 0 t e Tec nica Directors, aying out SID governance, integrating as an

Extended Enterprise, and aligning with corporate enablers. Look for more to come soon!
