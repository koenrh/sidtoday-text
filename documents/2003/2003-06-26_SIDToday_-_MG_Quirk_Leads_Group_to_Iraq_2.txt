One of the highlights of the trip was an opportunity to visit tactical SIGINT units. The 5015t
Battalion set up their SIGINT collection system here, at the Four Heads Palace in Baghdad.

MG Quirk posed with members of the 5015t Battalion of the lst Armored Division at the Four
Heads Palace in Baghdad. The group was able to discuss national to tactical integration and

View from the Four Heads Palace across Baghdad.
The warfighter's precision munitions may make a small hole to start...
...but they bring quite a bit of destruction (inside the Four Heads Palace, home to the 5015t).

At Abu Ghurayb prison, the group discussed the role of interrrogations and how they can provide
leads for SIGINT. They also visited one of Saddam's torture chambers.
