(U//FOUO) In recent months, SID has experienced a significant
turnover in leadership. This was not limited to the appointment of
MG Quirk and Charlie Meals as SID Director and Deputy Director-new leadership also has taken the helm of the SID Deputy
Directorates ( see related article HERE ). In the coming days, SID
Today will introduce you to the leaders-- both managers and
technical directors-- of the Deputy Directorates for Customer
Relationships, Analysis and Production, and Data Acquisition.
(U//FOUO) The leaders will share their thoughts on how they view
their roles in SID, how they like to operate, and what results they
would like to help SID and NSA achieve. We think this series of
articles will give you a better sense of where SID is headed and
how we intend to get there-- stay tuned!
