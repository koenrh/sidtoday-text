(U//FOUO) One thing is certain about NSA's workforce: it cannot
be pigeon-holed! Where else can you find linguists,
mathematicians, cryptologists, collectors, IT specialists, engineers,
signals analysts, writers, etc. all rubbing shoulders? In the coming
weeks, SID Today will run a series of articles spotlighting NSA's
Learned Organizations. These are organizations (such as the
Crypto-Mathematics Institute and the Crypto-Linguistic
Association, to name just two) that allow members of each
profession to share information on their specialized skills, recognize
outstanding achievements in their field, and interact with peers.
(U//FOUO) This series will let you know what organizations are out
there and what they have to offer. Stay tuned!
