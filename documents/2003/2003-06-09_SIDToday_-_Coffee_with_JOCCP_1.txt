(U) What do Lieutenant General Claudia J. Kennedy, USA, Major General James C. King, USA,
Brigadier General James A. Jaeger, USAF, and Brigadier General Neal Robinson, USAF all have in
common? They were graduates of the Junior Officer Cryptologic Career Program (JOCCP).

(U) The JOCCP was established in June 1971 by the DIRNSA, then Vice Admiral Noel Gaylor, to
develop the military's professional SIGINT officer cadre. The program offers participants a
unique 36—month opportunity to develop a broad technical and operational expertise through a
combination of academics and workcenter experience.

(U) The academic portion of JOCCP consists of over 1400 hours of coursework, taught by the
National Cryptologic School. These courses cover a wide range of technical subjects to prepare
the participants for their operational workcenter tours throughout NSA. Typically, each JOCCP
participant completes four workcenters, each normally siX—months in length. While these
workcenters usually focus on the cryptologic effort at NSA, participants often deploy in support
of other intelligence agencies and major military commands, wherever the country's interests
are threatened. The program currently has 38 participants and has graduated 335 officers.
