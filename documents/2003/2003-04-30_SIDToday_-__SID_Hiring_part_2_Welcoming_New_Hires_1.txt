RX I W (U) SID Hiring (part 2: Welcoming New Hires)

    

FROM: Maria Magoulas—Perkins
Chief, SIGINT People Office
Run Date: 04/30/2003

  

(U//FOUO) In part 1 of this message, 1 indicated that SID will hire over 500 people this year.
Please remember that it is not just the responsibility of the receiving supervisor but it is the

responsibility of us all to do our part to make our new hires feel welcomed and productive as
quickly as possible.

(U//FOUO) We all were new at one time and had to "learn the ropes." If we are indeed hiring the
most qualified applicants, then learning curves should not be overwhelming. (If we are not hiring
people with the requisite minimum job skills, then please advise the People Office so we can
help correct the problem.) Our new hires are an investment in our future. If we help them and
get them trained as quickly as possible despite our current workload, they will help us
immeasurably in the future by reducing that workload.

(U//FOUO) A series of on—line job aids are available to assist supervisors with a more friendly
and productive assimilation process. This website was developed for anyone who is responsible
for the in—house training and orientation of a new hire or veteran employees new to the office. It
can be accessed by typing 'go ojt' or by clicking here,

(U//FOUO) I would like to thank you all for your hard work and commitment to ensuring we get
the quality personnel to address our SIGINT requirements. I would like to thank you for
whatever part you play in making our new hires feel a welcomed, valued, and contributing
member of the SIGINT team.
