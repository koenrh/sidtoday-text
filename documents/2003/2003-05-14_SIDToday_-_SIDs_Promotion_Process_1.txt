RX I W (U) SID's Promotion Process

FROM: Charles Berlin
SID Chief of Staff
Run Date: 05/14/2003

 

\ .i

(U) Recently, Harvey Davis sent a message explaining the importance of
feedback in the ongoing Promotion and Awards Program Process. 1 would like to underscore that
SID is fully committed to this idea—— it is the right of every SID employee to receive thoughtful
and timely feedback from management on his or her performance, including one's standing for
possible promotion.

 

(U) Some may not be aware that the current process is about more than just promotions—— it
includes a range of awards for excellent performance, including monetary awards (such as
Quality Step Increases and Special Achievement Awards) and non—monetary awards (honorary
awards, time—off awards, etc.). We cannot promote everyone who is deserving——there are many
outstanding performers in SID and a finite number of promotions——but we do have other ways of
recognizing great work. We have committed a minimum of 50% of our award money to this
promotion cycle. Managers are looking at people's performance and potential, keeping in mind
SID's promotion and award dollars.

(U) While managers have a duty to provide productive feedback, there is also an employee's
responsibility to accept feedback well. Feedback is a two—way street—— listen to your manager
and try to understand what it is you must do to excel in the future. Our Workforce Management

Executive, m_, has a booklet, Ongoing Feedback: How to Get It, How to Use It ,
that might e e p u to you; please contact her if you would like one.

(U) MG Quirk and Charlie Meals view the workforce as the "top and bottom line" in SID—— they
are committed to a fair promotion and award system. Let's do our best to contribute to the
success of this process.

 

(U) The below resources are available to help managers provide effective feedback:

materiais.
