(U//FOUO) In the SID Town Meeting last month, SIGINT Director General Quirk and his deputy,
Charlie Meals, stated their strong commitment to act as a team and to move decision—making to
the right levels in the organization. The SID leaders have taken a major step toward this goal
through a 2—day offsite, which began yesterday at the University of Maryland's Institute for
Defense Analysis in Bowie, Maryland. Participating in the meeting are the SID Director and
Deputy Director, plus the leaders and technical directors of the SID Deputy Directorates and SID
staff.

current efforts, and identify challenges. Check future editions of SID Today for more on the
