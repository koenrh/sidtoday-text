(U//FOUO) The Human Resources Service Center for the Signals Intelligence Directorate has
recently been reorganized. A few employees have left and there are also some new faces to be
introduced.

(U//FOUO) Do you know your HR Advisor? Do you know which Program Manager handles which
programs? Do you know where to go for answers to your HR questions? We hope the following
helps guide you to the right person for your answers to P3 questions, awards, beneficiary forms,
marital status changes, military deposits, the FLIP program, and the TEDNE (Temporary
Employment During the National Emergency) program, just to name a few.

(U//FOUO) Please take a few minutes and become familiar with the names of the HR employees
who serve your organization. They are there to help you with all of your HR needs.
