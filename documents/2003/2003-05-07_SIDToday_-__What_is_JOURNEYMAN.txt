(U//FOUO) What is JOURNEYMAN?
FROM:
Deputy Chief, Customer Response
Run Date: 05/07/2003

(U//FOUO) The JOURNEYMAN program is a comprehensive effort to transform the way the
National Security Agency produces SIGINT (COMINT, ELINT, and FISINT) information and
subsequently provide that SIGINT information to our customers when, where, and how they
want to receive it. Bottom line, we're going to deliver new capabilities for authoring and
disseminating SIGINT information.
(U//FOUO) What does this mean for the analyst? --the ability to write once and disseminate
your information in the format the customer needs. For example, you, the analyst, may author
information that will be...
issued as an EGRAM-like report to customers on Intelink and via CRITICOMM,
issued as a SECRET-level report that will be sent over the SIPRnet with no attribution to
NSA, and
automatically parsed and included in a database the customer can access
...but you write it just once!
(U//FOUO) In addition, the SIGINT sourcing information will be retrievable without the need for
you to enter information into numerous fields on a source record sheet, while dissemination will
be driven by a customer profile much like a magazine subscription service. Further relief will be
afforded by desktop-validation capabilities, a robust workflow capability, and the automatic
identification of relevant Information Needs. Analysts will even be able to include multimedia
information in the report. This isn't going to happen overnight. We'll deliver capabilities
incrementally, using off-the-shelf software whenever possible.
(C) Our initial foray to deliver the Journeyman vision was the rollout of the SIGINT On Demand
Tool to all NSAW analysts in May 2002. This product continues to be refined, with the latest
version incorporating the current web-based application technologies (rollout scheduled for April
2003), and adding a commercial customer interface tool (June 2003) that will enhance both the
presentation of the information and metrics. Our next major effort will be the delivery of
TALISMAN (formerly the Consolidated Authoring Tool - CAT). A demonstration of this tool is
scheduled for April 2003, and there will be an Interim Operating Capability (IOC) in two NSAW
offices - that are currently being chosen - in September 2003. This tool will ultimately replace all
the legacy end-product reporting capabilities throughout the extended enterprise.
(U//FOUO) Please bear with us during the transformation. We're trying to connect different
systems/technology, some of it decades old; it isn't an easy process and sometimes we won't hit
a home run. We depend on you for input and suggestions to improve our current product suite,
or to identify the need for new capabilities. We encourage everyone to view our website ('go
JOURNEYMAN') for additional information on what projects are underway, provide feedback, and
view our vision of the future authoring and dissemination system by reading the JOURNEYMAN
CONOP or by contacting the JOURNEYMAN Project Manager,
