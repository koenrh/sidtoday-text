(U/FOUO) As the Technical Leader for Analysis & Production
(A&P;), my main concern is transformation of analysis, mission,
technology, and technical leadership. I ask myself on a weekly—— if
not daily—— basis, "Is A&P; moving forward in these areas?" In
analysis, I would like to see progress in implementing many of the
ideas outlined in Richard Heuer's seminal work, The Psychology of 1. Cumin: goon:
Intelligence Analysis . I believe this book should be required .‘ .tin to Kng‘w' the

provide analysts better access and tools in the near future. 5'

(U/FOUO) Finally, building more technical leaders is essential. The
model of the new working relationship between senior
management and technical leaders was set at the creation of the
SIGINT Directorate. Great progress has been made in this regard
and will continue as technical experts supplement their knowledge
with an understanding of many basic SID processes such as
requirements, systems engineering, and programmatics.
