(U) We'd like to give you a sense of what the new SID leaders have been doing in their first
weeks on the job.
(U//FOUO) Since April 21st, MG Quirk and Charlie Meals have already visited a number of SID
organizations to meet members of the workforce and become better acquainted with both
mission and human resources topics. On April 22nd, they toured several Customer Relationships
(S1) offices, including:
Requirements Analysis Center
Military Integration
Customer Response
Customer Account Management
SINIOs (SIGINT National Intelligence Officers)
National Tactical Integration
(U//FOUO) This was followed up by a 24 April visit to Data Acquisition (S3) offices, including:
Current Operations Division
Special Source Mission Management
Systems Analysis
Commercial Technology
(U//FOUO) MG Quirk and Charlie Meals also plan on visiting elements of Analysis & Production
(S2) in the near future. They were very impressed by their visits and greatly enjoyed the
opportunity to meet directly with the workforce--something they hope will happen regularly.
(S//SI) The SID Director and Deputy Director have also met with NSA leadership outside of SID,
such as the Acting General Council, Vito Potenza; the Principal Director for Foreign Affairs, 
; and the Senior Acquisition Executive, Paul Schneider. MG Quirk even engaged in
some international dialogue, namely a discussion with Mr. 
 the Deputy
Director of the Norwegian Intelligence Service's Collection Division (the Norwegian equivalent to
NSA).
