Course Overview:

(U) Following 9/11, the world's attention was focused on Afghanistan, but terrorism existed in
Southeast Asia as well. Two Americans were being held hostage by a Philippines terrorist group,
and the Jamaah Islamiyah was planning attacks against US interests in Singapore. As more
information has come to light, these Southeast Asia terrorist organizations have been revealed
to have close ties with al—Qaida and are receiving both training and money. The presentation will
cover the main terrorist organizations in the Philippines (MNLF, MILF, and ASG) and the Jammah
Islamiyah by looking at the history of these groups, their aims, activities, and what is being
done about them.

(U//FOUO) Please consult the SINIO Website ("go sinio") for information on future events in this
