(U//FOUO) Where can you turn for information when you've been told you'll be deploying to a
hostile area and need weapons training? What if you think someone you supervise is
contemplating suicide? How can your family find out about benefits they may be eligible for if
you're injured or killed on the job? Would you like to learn how to cope with shift work or donate
blood to aid victims of disaster or get help settling a dispute with a coworker?

(U//FOUO) The Associate Directorate for Human Resource Services (HRS) has compiled a listing
of web sites to support employees who are facing potentially stressful situations. They've
brought together information published separately by HRS as well as Occupational Health,
Environmental Services (OHESS), the US. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and others.
There's a checklist to prepare you and your family for your absence during a TDY, information on
being called to active duty from military reserve status, pay and leave guidance for various
situations, and points of contact for organizations that can provide the support you need to
maintain your wellâ€”being through this lengthening period of increased vigilance.

(U//FOUO) You can find all this and much more by clicking HERE , or link to it from the SID
home page. A link will soon be established from the SIGINT Pee )le Office. web site as well. We
may never back down from those threatening our lives and our freedom, but we sometimes
need to step back for a moment to make sure we're taking care of our best weapon in the fight:
ourselves.
