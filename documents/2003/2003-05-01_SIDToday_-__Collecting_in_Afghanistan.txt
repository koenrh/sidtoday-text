(S//SI) Collecting in Afghanistan
FROM: CPT (P) 
Tactical Platforms Systems Integration
Run Date: 05/01/2003

(S//SI) Last summer, U.S. military officials generated an intelligence requirement for NSA: they
needed a quick reaction capability system for locally collecting against High Power Cordless
Phones (HPCP) used by suspected al-Qa'ida and Taliban forces in Afghanistan. Remarkably, it
took Data Acquisition's Tactical Platforms organization only 60 days to build, test, and field a
system to satisfy this requirement.
(S//SI) The result was MINUTEMAN PROMETHEUS, a Pelican case-mounted, man-portable
system. Tactical Platforms used commercially-available technology and existing
hardware/software and built them into a unique system designed from the ground up, which
enabled a low cost per system. The project was a joint effort, with MINUTEMAN acting as
deployment lead and providing hardware, MUSKETEER providing software, and the Army
Cryptologic Office providing technical and financial mission support.
(S//SI) Deployment of this capability allows Special Forces teams to conduct close-in collection
against adversaries in Afghan "hot spots" to obtain real-time indications and warning and
targeting information. MINUTEMAN PROMETHEUS serves as an example of how, through
collaboration, SID can use existing capabilities to respond quickly to customer needs. With the
collection environment evolving at an ever-increasing pace, this adaptability will help us stay a
step ahead of the game!
