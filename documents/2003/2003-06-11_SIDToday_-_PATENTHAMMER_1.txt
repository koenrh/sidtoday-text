RE“ I W (U//FOU0) PATENTHAMMER

      

FROM: “I USAF
Chief, Nationa Tactica Integration Office

Run Date: 06/1 1/2003

(S//SI) After 9/11, the Special Operations Command (SOCOM) identified a major gap in its
threat warning coverage against terrorist cellular, faX, and pager communications. They needed
help, and the Customer Relationships Directorate's National Tactical Integration Office (NTIO)
responded. The NTIO provided a portable, advanced signal collection system with a remote,
reach—back capability to Special Operations Forces and Navy SEALs deploying to Kosovo,
Georgia, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the Philippines. This system, PATENTHAMMER,
was already in development as a National Tactical Integration (NTI) proof—of—concept to
demonstrate reach—forward/ reach—back operations and to promote technology insertion into
tactical SIGINT capabilities.

(U) What Does "Reach Forward" and "Reach Back" Mean?

(U) Reach—forward capabilities enable personnel in surface/ground and national facilities to
obtain current information from active collection assets. With this information, an analyst in an
intelligence center can fuse multiple data inputs to more effectively support cross—system
cueing, data correlation, or other intelligence functions.

(U) Reach—back capabilities allow active collection assets to "reach back" into databases of
surface/ground and national facilities to retrieve information that will assist them in satisfying
their operational tasking. For example, an airborne reconnaissance operator can obtain historical
data (reach back) as well as current information (reach forward) on a target of interest that
other sensors covering the same operational theater provide.

(5) Army Incorporates PATENTHAMMER Technology Into its PROPHET System

(S) Based on successful PATENTHAMMER demonstrations, the Army has incorporated
PATENTHAMMER technology into PROPHET, its tactical SIGINT/Early Warning system. PROPHET
provides force protection by allowing the Brigade Commander to visualize his battle space.
Specifically, it provides:

0 relevant, time—critical actionable information such as reports of intercepted voice
communications and Lines of Bearing location data on target emitters.

0 early warning of potential threats in areas of operation, using collected SIGINT and
ground surveillance information.

(S) As a result of PATENTHAMMER technology, the Army is now able to provide SIGINT
capabilities against modern signals (e.g., cellular, faX, and pager) two years ahead of schedule.
Ten PATENTHAMMER systems—— consisting of collection radios with line—of—sight, DF, and MVSAT
communications packages—— were incorporated into PROPHET in support of Operation Iraqi
Freedom. The first four of these Army PROPHET—HAMMER systems have already been deployed
to units in the Baghdad, Mosul, and Tikrit areas of Iraq with the remaining siX to follow this
summer.

(El/SI) Army Teams With GRSOC/PROPHET-HAMMER System Placed in GRSOC Cell

(S//SI) Army involvement in the PATENTHAMMER program led to a teaming effort with the Ft
Gordon Regional Security Operations Center (GRSOC) to place a PROPHET—HAMMER back—end
system in the GRSOC Tactical Cell. This summer, GRSOC will have direct connectivity to all
PROPHET—HAMMER systems deployed in Iraq. This will enable them to share data, tune
PROPHET—HAMMER receivers, listen to live voice intercepts, obtain DF information on signals,
and survey the signal spectrum.
