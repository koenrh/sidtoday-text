%\ I W (S) NCPAC Personnel Deploy to Support Operation Iraqi Freedom

FROM:
NCPAC F406 SIGINT Operations Division
Run Date: 05/12/2003

      

(S) Six personnel assigned to the NSA/CSS Pacific (NCPAC) SIGINT Operations Division recently
returned from Central Command (CENTCOM) Headquarters in Tampa, Florida, where they
provided augmentation support to the "Operation Iraqi Freedom" campaign. Analysts were
assigned various positions of responsibility in management, targeting, Battle Damage
Assessment (BDA), Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), watch supervision, and the Cryptologic
Services Group (CSG) watch. Every position was manned 24/7 throughout the conduct of the
campaign.

(S//SI) Activities included the development of time sensitive targeting through the fusion of
SIGINT and IMINT data, providing timely BDA derived from SIGINT, targeting of Iraqi air
defense assets based on ELINT collection, researching possible locations of stockpiled WMD
material, and leading the joint intelligence watch in providing timely support to all facets of the
campaign. Maintaining a constant dialogue with NSA—— including NSOC, Special Support Activity
(SSA), Battle Bridge, Geospatial Exploitation, Targeting Support Activity, and the Iraq Theater
Analysis Cel|—— as well as GRSOC and the NSA representation at CENTCOM Forward, proved
extremely valuable in the accomplishment of each mission.

(C) Each NCPAC analyst gained valuable operational experience in providing SIGINT support in a
combat environment. This knowledge will be applied to ongoing NCPAC support to military
operations in the Pacific Area of Responsibility (AOR) and will enhance NCPAC's ability to support
a broader campaign in the region should the need arise. Likewise, CENTCOM benefited from the
diverse knowledge and capabilities of the augmentees. This challenging period reminded all of us
that we really are one team, and highlighted our organizational ability to pull together personnel
from across the enterprise to provide essential mission support to our warfighting customer.
