%\ \ I W (U) Stand-up of the Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC)

FROM: Charlie Meals
Signals Intelligence Deputy Director
Run Date: 05/06/2003

      

(U//FOUO) Thursday, 1 May, marked the official stand—up of the Terrorist Threat Integration
Center (TTIC), located at CIA Headquarters. The 'I'I'IC was established by direction of the
President of the United States as the single U.S. government focal point for all terrorist threat
information, foreign and domestic.

(U//FOUO) Mr. John Brennan, the TTIC Director, envisions the 'I'I'IC as the hub for information
on terrorism threats——a joint venture of member agencies bringing their authorities with them to
the TTIC. The TTIC staff is responsible for assessing, integrating, and expeditiously
disseminating available threat information and analysis; maintaining an all—source database on
known and suspected terrorists; and identifying collection requirements related to the terrorist
threat. They will ensure terrorist threat information is quickly turned around and delivered
through the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to local and state officials and others as
needed.

(U//FOUO) Mr. Bill Gaches has been assigned from NSA as the 'I'I'IC Deputy Director, Threat
Monitoring, Integration & Analysis. — is the Senior NSA Representative to the
TTIC. She will:

0 coordinate NSA—'I'I'IC activities;

0 share information with NSA analysts at CIA, FBI, DHS, and other agencies as needed;
and

a provide support and "reach back" to NSA to facilitate all—source threat analysis from both
the Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and the Information Assurance (IA) Directorates.

(U//FOUO) NSA's association with the TTIC is a groundbreaking opportunity for the Agency to
support national decision—makers in the Counterterrorism and Homeland Security Community. I
attended Thursday's ribbon cutting ceremony on behalf of the Director, and I believe the 'I'I'IC
and DHS will complement each other in a way that will ensure the right people get the
information they need to protect the nation. Please join MG Quirk and me in fully supporting this
new, but vital, organization and in providing all possible assistance to the NSAers at 'I'I'IC.

(U//FOUO) For more information on the TTIC, contact— _(s).
