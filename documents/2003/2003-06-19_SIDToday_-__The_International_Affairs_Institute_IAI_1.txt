(U//FOUO) In 1971, a small group of energetic individuals founded
the International Affairs Institute (IAI) with the intent of presenting
to the NSA populace a variety of distinguished speakers from the
fields of business, politics, the military, and academia. Their aim
was to promote an interest in international events and affairs while
providing unique insights into those issues. That mission continues 1.
today, as the IAI routinely hosts speakers from classified and

unclassified arenas to lecture on hot topics in international affairs

and encourages its members to write and publish papers on related 2.
subjects. 3.
