(Cl/SI) CATAPULT: A Bilateral Data Port

(U//FOUO) As you read in esterda H's article JOURNEYMAN is a comprehensive, evolving
program to transform SIGINT product authoring and dissemination. In that article we mentioned
the SIGINT on Demand (SOD) product as one of the first deliverables under the JOURNEYMAN
umbrella. The Customer Relationships Directorate's (CRD) Customer Response office has
another initiative——called CATAPULT——underway that also will be folded into JOURNEYMAN.

 

(C//SI) CATAPULT is a joint project between NSA and Canada's SIGINT organization, the
Communications Security Establishment (CSE), to prototype a data portal for exchanging
SIGINT product between NSA and its 2nd Party Partners. The CATAPULT data portal contains all
2nd Party viewable product shared with CSE to include multimedia reporting, CRITICOMM
released product, and SIGINT on Demand (SOD) items. CATAPULT——based on SLINGSHOT, a
CSE project that provides a similar capability——is implemented at CSE and is accessible from
NSANet via a browser interface.

(C//SI) As part of its efforts, the Joint End Product Piannincﬁ Group (JEPPG) is sponsoring an
initiative to establish an XML sta rd for the exchange of 2nd Party multimedia product,
eliminating the need for any additional automated or manual formatting. In February, we began
the exchange of XML—formatted SOD product and metadata for inclusion in CATAPULT and
SLINGSHOT——a step up from the text—only email format that was used before. The lessons
learned from our experience with CSE on the CATAPULT prototype are being applied to data
exchanges with our other 2nd Party partners, as well. In April, Customer Response began
forwarding XML formatted SOD product and metadata to the United Kingdom's SIGINT
organization Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ).

 

(S//SI) In March, over fifty NSA personne|——drawn from the China/Korea product line,
TRAILBLAZER Target Operational Pilot (TOP), and Customer Response organizations——began
attending half—day training sessions on "CATAPULT Basics." Customer Response continues to
identify additional analysts as CATAPULT users; the current configuration can accommodate 200
simultaneous users. During a period extending through April, users will evaluate CATAPULT and
generate additional multimedia requirements for the broader JOURNEYMAN program.

(C//SI) For additional information on CATAPULT and the exchange of multimedia product with
our 2nd Party partners, contact —, Customer Response/Delivery Techniques, -
