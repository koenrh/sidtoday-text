RX I W (El/SI) Support to UN Diplomatic Efforts on Iraq

FROM: Chris Inglis

Run Date: 04/07/2003
(S//SI) SIGINT support to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations has enabled and continues to
enable the diplomatic campaign against Iraq. Your efforts have been essential to the plans of
the U.S. Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador John D. Negroponte, as well as to
the United Kingdom's Permanent Representative, HMA Sir Jeremy Greenstock.

 

(S//SI) Ambassador Negroponte took time in February 2003 to provide unsolicited feedback on
the quality, timeliness, and quantity of NSA reporting. He said that he could not imagine better
intelligence support for diplomatic activity than he receives from the daily NSA reporting on Iraq
and the UN. He was especially grateful for the timeliness of the information and asked our
representative at the U.S. Mission to the UN, _ to pass his thanks to the many people
involved in its production and delivery. His only complaint was that "there's just so much good
stuff to read and so little time to do it!" Ambassador Negroponte has been an avid user of
SIGINT for many years and visited NSA in February 2002, exclaiming that he has never received
better support in his 40—year diplomatic career. It is our hope that the Ambassador will visit NSA
again when the frenzy of the Iraqi crisis subsides.

(S//SI) For his part, Ambassador Greenstock, on the very day in February that he tabled the
UK—US—Spain "second resolution" on Iraq, intrigued by the close UK—US intelligence cooperation,
said that SIGINT insights into the nuances of internal divisions among the five permanent
members of the UN Security Council (the "P5") were highly useful, enabling him to decide what
line to take with P5 counterparts in New York and Washington and to temper the language of his
diplomatic forays. On 5 February, the day that Secretary of State Powell made his presentation
at the UN Security Council and, as a direct result of SIGINT reporting, a last—minute amendment
was made to the UK Foreign Secretary's speech, making the point that UNMOVIC inspections
had already been substantially reinforced.
