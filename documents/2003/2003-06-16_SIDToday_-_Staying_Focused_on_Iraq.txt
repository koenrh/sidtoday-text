(U//FOUO) Staying Focused on Iraq
FROM: MG Richard J. Quirk, USA
Signals Intelligence Director
Run Date: 06/16/2003

(U//FOUO) The Director's final WARgram on Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) acknowledges his
pride in the accomplishments of NSA/CSS in meeting the challenges set before us just over one
year ago. I echo that pride, both for those whose mission was specifically linked to OIF and for
those who by diligent attention to their mission made our focus on OIF possible.
(S) An important message for the Signals Intelligence Directorate can be found at the end of the
second paragraph in the Director's WARgram, it reads: "Although major combat is over, Iraq is
still a troubled environment and much work needs to be done." Many of you who remain
intimately involved in the Iraqi mission are aware of the issues that underpin this statement. As
we seek to rebalance resources and priorities across a broader set of targets, we must ensure
that we sustain the right focus on Iraq and the issues attendant to that challenge. The success
that was achieved at a cost to so many could be lost if we let our vigilence slip during this crucial
period. I urge my leadership team, the Issue Managers, the Phase IV planning team and the
Functional Leads to redouble their efforts to maintain the necessary focus and attention to our
role in enabling the peace.
