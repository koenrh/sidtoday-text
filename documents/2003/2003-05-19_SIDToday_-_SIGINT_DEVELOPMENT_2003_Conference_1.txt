SIGINT Deve opment Strategy and Governance

Run Date: 05/19/2003

(U//FOUO) Preparations are in full swing for the international SIGINT Development 2003
conference, "Creating Opportunities Through Collaboration", which will be held at NSA, 09—13
June 2003.

(U//FOUO) The conference will kick off in Friedman Auditorium with a Keynote Address by SID
Director MG Richard J. Quirk, followed by "State of SIGINT Development" addresses by SIGINT
Development leaders from NSA, GCHQ, CSE, DSD, and GCSB. The remainder of the conference
will consist of a series of workshops in smaller conference rooms with a format designed to
encourage lively discussion among the participants.

(C) The agenda includes something for everyone involved or interested in SIGINT Development.
We are offering workshops on Convergence/Cross Media Chaining, Network Analysis, Follow the
Money/People/Goods, Target Templating, Social Network Analysis, Skills & Training, and Policy &
Legalities, during which briefers will present the latest SIGDEV tools and techniques and will
provide ample opportunity for valuable analyst exchange to help solve some of SIGINT's most
challenging problems. On Thursday 12 June, there will be a special session on Fiber Optics
consisting of an unclassified tutorial sponsored by the Laboratory for Telecommunications
Sciences in the morning which will acquaint analysts with the technology. Thursday afternoon
NSA technical leaders will conduct a classified session presenting specific case studies to help
analysts understand optical networking from a SIGINT perspective and to illustrate what is
important to analyze and report from that environment. Sidebar sessions on Wireless LANs,
Geographic Information Systems, Internet Research, and Highlights of SIGINT Development at
field sites round out the program. Throughout the week, there will be a wide range of live
demonstrations of tools along with on—site tours of organizations involved in or supporting
SIGDEV activities.
