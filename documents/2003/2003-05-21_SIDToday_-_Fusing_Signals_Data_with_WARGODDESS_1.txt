(S//SI) In recent years, SID has taken a number of steps to provide intelligence to its customers
in a format that is of maximum usefulness to its users. A good example of this is the
WARGODDESS program. This is an effort to build information systems that fuse multiple sources
of data (mainly SIGINT, but also MASINT and IMINT) to give both intelligence producers and
operational warfighters dramatically improved battlespace awareness and target understanding.
By intelligently correlating and fusing multiple sources of signal data, a WARGODDESS— based
system can help characterize targets and threats and produce estimates about the targets and
their intentions.

(S//SI) What progress has been made so far? WARGODDESS systems have successfully
supported several military operations, including those in Afghanistan and Iraq. The system
directly supported the time—sensitive targeting of mobile surface—to—air—missile systems in Iraq
during the initial stages of the Operation Iraqi Freedom air campaign, producing a real—time
tracking picture. Members of Central Command Air Forces in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and South
Carolina praised SID's Ground Systems Office (GSO)—— the program office—— for the system's
performance and the individual efforts of all those involved. In addition, Lt Gen Mosley, the
Combined Forces Air Component Commander, personally thanked NSA Director Lt Gen Hayden
for this support.

(S//SI) As a result of this success, GSO has received numerous requests for additional systems
deployments both inside and outside the US. SIGINT System. The GSO team met with Lt Gen
Hayden on April 10th, and SID Director MG Quirk on May 5th for initial discussions on the way
forward for the WARGODDESS Program. In early May 2003, a WARGODDESS client was
deployed to Ramstein, Germany for the US. Air Force's 26 Information Operations Group (IOG)
operators to evaluate; and in mid—June an upgrade will be deployed to the system at the Medina
Regional Security Operations Center (MRSOC). In addition, it appears that the GSO leadership
may transition the WARGODDESS technology base to a larger program in future.
