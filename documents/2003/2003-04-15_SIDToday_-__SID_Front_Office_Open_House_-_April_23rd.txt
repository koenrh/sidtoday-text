(U) SID Front Office Open House - April 23rd
FROM: Maureen Baginski
Signals Intelligence Director
Run Date: 04/15/2003

(U//FOUO) As I've said before, the past 2 1/2 years has been a time of
extraordinary success for SIGINT. The single reason for the success is all of
you--the incredibly talented and dedicated men and women who perform
miracles in defense of the nation every day. As Chris Inglis, Bill Crumm and I depart, we want to
somehow express our gratitude to you. We realize that nothing we do could properly
acknowledge the national treasure that is the SID workforce. But we are going to try anyway!
(U) On 23 April, from 1000-1200, we will open the SID front office (2W106), equip it with
goodies (that's the bribe part!), and take some time to thank all of you who are able to stop by
for what you have done for us personally and professionally, and of course, for what you've done
for the nation. We understand the demands of mission and how precious time is to each of you.
We hope you can find the time to visit and let us say thanks. We can't guarantee we won't run
out of goodies, but our supply of gratitude and respect is unlimited, whether you are able to
come by or not. As always, thanks for all you do. Hope to see you on the 23rd.
(U) Thanks.
Mo
