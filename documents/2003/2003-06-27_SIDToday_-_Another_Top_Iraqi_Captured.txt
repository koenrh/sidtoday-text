(U) Another Top Iraqi Captured
FROM:
Chief, Geospatial Exploitation
Run Date: 06/27/2003

(TS//SI//OC) On 17 June, U.S. Special Forces in Iraq captured Mahmud al-Tikriti, number four
on the CENTCOM target list and the Ace of Diamonds in the CENTCOM card deck, along with
several members of his family. Mahmud and his family were known to be facilitating movement
of wanted individuals between Syria and Iraq. The SIGINT system, working in concert with
sensitive HUMINT sources, played a very prominent role in Mahmud's capture.
(TS//SI//OC,REL) The Geospatial Exploitation Office (GEO) provided near-real-time tipping to
Special Operations Forces engaged in the hunt. Additionally, linguists from two other SID
Product Lines provided rapid turnaround of speaker identity information and conversation
content, adding key context information to the location data being sent forward. Data
Acquisition personnel executed some quick-reaction activities to establish and maintain
continuity of coverage on the targeted communications.
(S) At the receiving end was a National Intelligence Support Team (NIST) element, deployed
with the supported forces, that helped coordinate the information flow throughout the operation
and ensured that the warfighter both received and understood the SIGINT.
(TS//SI) While this operational model has been used frequently over the last several months,
this particular operation represents an extraordinarily successful merger of a wide range of skills
areas within the SIGINT enterprise, along with information from other intelligence assets,
leading to the capture of a key Iraqi target.
