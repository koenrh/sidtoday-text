(U) ConSIDer This: Military Rank Abbreviations

(U) Civilians: do you know how to abbreviate U.S. military ranks? Each military service uses its
own abbreviation scheme. For example, the Army, Air Force and Marine Corps all use the rank of
lieutenant colonel, but they abbreviate this rank as LTC, Lt Col (with a blank space), and LtCol
(without a space), respectively. As you can see in the tables below, the Army and Navy use
upper case in its abbreviations, while the Air Force and Marine Corps generally use a
combination of upper and lower case. Note also that certain ranks are used by only one military
branch; this is especially true in the case of the Navy:
