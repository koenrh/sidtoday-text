(C) On Thursday, the SINIO Council and the National Cryptologic School are pleased to present
the first in a series of Strategic Intelligence Issue Seminars for Summer 2003. "Tough Times for
Turkey" will be presented by the Deputy SINIO for Europe, —, on Thursday, 12 June
from 10:30 to 12:30 in Room 234118-6 . Advance registration is required; click HE‘ I for
instructions.

Course Overview:

(C) The fallout from the Iraqi campaign has been largely negative for Turkey, and the full impact
of this very bitter episode in U.S.— Turkish relations is still unknown. The pro—Islam Justice and
Development Party (AKP) and the Turkish General Staff (TGS), guardian of Turkey's secular
democracy, view each other with mutual suspicion. The strategic relationship with the US. is
seriously weakened, so the US. is unlikely to champion Turkey's cause in Europe or with the
IMF/World Bank as fervently. In addition, Turkey's regional influence, particularly in northern
Iraq, has been significantly diminished. The presentation will examine the impact that major
differences in expectations, perceptions, threat definition, decisionmaking, and communication
had on the strategic relationship and assess the likely long—term impact.
