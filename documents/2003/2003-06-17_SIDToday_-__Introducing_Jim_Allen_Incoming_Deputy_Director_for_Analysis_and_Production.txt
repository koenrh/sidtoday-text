(U//FOUO) When the SIGINT Communications Team asked me to
describe my leadership style, I found myself thinking of those
attributes taught in courses and exhibited by superior leaders I
have observed. Some of those attributes are to know and act upon
what's important, to guide, empower, trust, communicate, to
encourage initiative and collaboration, and to provide a positive
example. I may adjust when required, and I may fall short on
occasion, but I am genuine in my commitment to these ideals;
you'll have ample opportunity to determine how close I come!
(U//FOUO) To round out the picture in terms that are a bit more
illustrative, I'll tell you as well that I believe it is my responsibility
to interpret and implement the Director's vision corporately and for
A&P; specifically. I like consensus and will work to achieve it, but I
will make decisions without it. I want to build a team that executes
to a high standard of performance, with people at all levels
anticipating and embracing challenges, tackling those things that
matter most. That includes having each individual making
decisions as appropriate and not waiting or deferring
unnecessarily.
(U//FOUO) I want us to be open and honest, to feel confident, to
learn from all that we do and from the successes and failures of
others. I am sure these qualities are all central to the organization
I am joining, and I will do my best to strengthen and continue the
progress being made.
