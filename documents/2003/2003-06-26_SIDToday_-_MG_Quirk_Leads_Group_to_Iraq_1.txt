The trip from Qatar to Iraq in a C—130 comes with all the expected modern travel conveniences:
a web seat and ear plugs.

MG Quirk gains insight into the deteriorating weather conditions from the pilot of the C—130 (the
flight out was provided by a unit from the Kentucky National Guard).

The group was met by _, NCR Iraq, (far left) upon arriving at the Baghdad
International Airport.

Living quarters were provided at this villa at Saddam's Presidential Palace North at CAMP
VICTORY, home to CJTF—7 HQ, near Baghdad International Airport.

SID has analysts deployed here, at the Iraq Survey Group (ISG) HQ in Camp SLAYER, within
another of Saddam's palace complexes. The primary mission for the ISG is the search for
weapons of mass destruction (WMD).

For travel outside the the protected zones, helmets, armored vests, and weaponry are
expected.

The Coalition Provisional Authority Palace, aka Saddam's former presidential palace, located in
central Baghdad on the banks of the Tigris River. Here the group met with NCR Iraq staff.

The group also met with Ambassador McManaway, then deputy to Ambassador Bremer, the
head of the Coalition Provisional Authority. During the visit, the group passed through the
palace 's chapel, shown here. Note the mural on the far end depicting Scud missiles rising to the
