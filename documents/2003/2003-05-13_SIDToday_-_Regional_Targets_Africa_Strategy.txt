(S//SI) Regional Targets' Africa Strategy
FROM: the SIGINT Communications Team
Unknown
Run Date: 05/13/2003

(S//SI) In the wake of 9/11, SID needed to quickly construct a SIGINT attack against terrorist
targets in the Horn of Africa--an experience that yielded some valuable lessons learned. These
lessons have now been applied towards our SIGINT efforts elsewhere on the continent, in the
form of SID/Regional Targets' Africa Strategy.
(S//SI) The Strategy builds on the four central lessons learned, which now form the
cornerstones of a SIGINT strategy . These include the need to:
collaborate (with CIA, the Commands, GRSOC, 2nd/3rd Parties, and carefully selected
African governments),
smartly allocate scarce resources (by focusing resources temporarily on crisis and
pre-emergent hot spots),
augment the linguistic/analytic workforce (using contractors as a force
multiplier/teaming with host nation linguists), and
improve agility through SIGINT development and training.
The Strategy focuses Regional Targets' Sub-Saharan Africa Division on how best to protect
American lives, property, and national interests in Africa by responding to a wide spectrum of
customer Intelligence Needs. It takes into account numerous factors, such as prospects for
cooperating with other governments and potential new sources of collection sponsored by the
European Command (EUCOM).
(S//SI) The post-9/11 surge against terrorist-related targets on the Horn has now become
manageable--this has freed up some analysts and linguists to look at the "rest of Africa." NSA
managers have done predictive analysis and held planning sessions with SINIOs and customers
to help them make informed decisions in positioning these personnel. The Division's
organizational structure is now flatter than in the past, with few managers and every available
linguist and analyst working some part of the SIGINT production cycle. The workforce is
organized regionally, with resources allocated according to the needs of the Global War on
Terrorism. Analysts engage various elements of the Extended Enterprise and external
organizations to help produce SIGINT-- the Division is eager to collaborate with any partner who
can fill a gap or enhance effectiveness.
(S//SI) The Africa Plan is being implemented within the Division by internally staffed Focus
Groups formed around the "cornerstones" mentioned above. These Focus Groups generate ideas
and actions and help the Division stay aggressive. It is entirely possible that these focus groups
will morph into quasi-managerial units from which Division-wide guidance and tasking will
originate. Want to know more about this Strategy, or get a status update on its implementation?
