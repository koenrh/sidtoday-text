§~ I W (U) GEOCELL Supports IRAQI FREEDOM

Run Date: 04/03/2003

(S//SI) As a part of the overall SID strategy, the Geospatial Exploitation Office (GEO) is among
the NSA elements providing 24/7, near—real—time intelligence to coalition forces in Iraq, while
still supporting operations supporting the Global War on Terrorism. As NSA prepared for
operation IRAQI FREEDOM, the GEO developed and installed interactive metadata mapping
layers on a web—based mapping server, and made this server accessible through the Iraq
Theater Analysis Cell's (ITAC) Intelink web portal. This site enables specific NSA partners and
customers, both in CONUS and forward—deployed, to select, view and analyze geo—location data
on Personal Communications Systems (PCS) activity in and around Iraq.

(S//SI) As coalition forces have transitioned to combat operations, the GEO Watch has
implemented a number of analysis and reporting activities designed to provide identification and
tracking of key PCS users in Iraq, and to support the situational awareness and force protection
needs of our troops in the field. These GEO Watch activities include near—real—time tipping of
communications associated with Iraqi leadership and other high—value targets, change—detection
reporting on specific terminals of interest, and immediate tipping of potential threat activity in
more than 600 areas of force protection concern in both the CENTCOM and EUCOM areas of

interest.

(S//SI) In addition, the GEO continues its close coordination with NSOC, the ITAC and other
agency elements supporting operations in Iraq, to ensure the continued availability of timely,
actionable intelligence to our customers—— SIGINT that makes a difference. For more information
