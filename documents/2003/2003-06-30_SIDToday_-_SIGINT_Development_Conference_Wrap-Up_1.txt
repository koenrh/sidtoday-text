FROM: —
SIGINT Deve opment Strategy and Governance

Run Date: 06/30/2003

(C) It was standing—room—only at this year's (9—13 June) successful SIGDEV Conference.
Following SID Director Quirk's keynote address (see article in NSA Daily ), workshops were held
on the following topics:

Follow the Money/People/Goods,
Convergence/Cross Media Chaining,
Network Analysis,

Fiber Optics,

High—speed Broad Band Access and Survey,
Social Network Analysis, and

Target Templating.

(C) Small groups held in—depth discussions on SIGDEV Skills and Training and explored the
policy and legal issues that can impact both the SIGDEV business and effective collaboration.
Attendees also had the opportunity to hear more about SIGINT Development in the Field,
Internet Research techniques, Target Technology Trends, and the value of exploiting GIS/CAD.
Throughout the week, SIGDEV organizations opened their doors for tours, tools demonstrations,
and hands—on training using SIGDEVToday, the SIGDEV Learning Portal.

(U//FOUO) During the week, participants renewed old acquaintences and forged new
relationships, fully realizing the theme of this year's conference: "Creating Opportunities
Through Collaboration." Because of the overwhelming response to the conference, some
participants were not able to get into their first choice workshops. The conference proceedings,
consisting of PowerPoint presentations and handouts used during the conference are now posted
to the 502003 web a 63, . Over the next few weeks, SIGDEV Strategy and Governance (SSG) will
sponsor encore presentations of several popular briefings, while others will be videotaped for
viewing on the SIGDEVToday page.

 

(U) SSG want to particularly thank all the briefers, volunteers, and participants who helped to
make this year's conference such a success!
