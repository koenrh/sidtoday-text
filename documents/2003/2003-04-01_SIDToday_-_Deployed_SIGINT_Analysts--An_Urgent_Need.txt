(U//FOUO) Deployed SIGINT Analysts--An Urgent Need
FROM: MG Richard J. Quirk, USA
Signals Intelligence Deputy Director
Run Date: 04/01/2003

(S//SI) In my last message to you, I noted that SIGINT is wired into our military operations as
never before. A key role in this effort is played by SID analysts who have deployed to the field,
providing direct support to our customers--and we need your help in ensuring that this vital
support continues.
(S//SI) Our deployed analysts are working closely with military intelligence staff: passing them
SIGINT, providing analysis, and fusing data. Their work has a direct and crucial impact on our
military operations, potentially saving lives. NSA and our customers owe a debt of gratitude to
these analysts who have made personal sacrifices to contribute to the war effort. They have
done outstanding work!
(S//SI) There is an urgent need, however, for additional analysts to fill these positions. I urge
both military and civilian SIGINT analysts to consider volunteering for 90-120 day NIST
(National Intelligence Support Team) deployments--your contribution could be key to our
success. For information on applying for one of these positions, please go to the following URL:
