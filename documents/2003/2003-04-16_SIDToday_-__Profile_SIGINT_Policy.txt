(U) As a continuation of our series of profiles of SID
Communications and Support Operations, today we focus on
SIGINT Policy.
(U) What would SID be like if we had no policies or rules to guide
us? Fortunately, we don't have to worry-- the office of SIGINT
Policy is here to help our operations run smoothly. The office of
SIGINT Policy:
Ensures that new SIGINT relationships, authorities, and
processes are supported by the necessary policy documents
and vetted with the key stakeholders. This creation and
vetting of policies can sometimes be a painstaking process,
but the results support SIGINT mission requirements. The
results also allow us to more consistently understand and
implement the associated processes, leading to a smoother
flow of operations.
Documents important precedents and key baselines for
continued forward movement. In fact, many of today's
policy documents are considered to be "living documents" to
keep pace with the SIGINT evolution.

(U) The SIGINT Policy office is very customer-focused. We devote a
great deal of time to responding to customer requests worldwide
for assistance in locating or interpreting policies applicable to their
needs. We also help customers determine which policy vehicle will
best accommodate documentation of SIGINT Directorate or
corporate approval for a variety of initiatives.
(U) The office also formulates and writes policies to document new
initiatives, fill existing policy gaps, or replace obsolete guidance.
We choose from the following policy vehicles based on the content
and desired audience:
NSA Policies
SID Policy Memoranda
SID Directives
U.S. SIGINT Directives (USSID)
SID Facts & Findings
Memoranda of Agreement/Understanding (MOA/MOU)
