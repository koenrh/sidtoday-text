(U//FOUO) On 24 February, President Bush signed National Security Presidential Directive
(NSPD—26) entitled "Intelligence Priorities," which completely overhauled the intelligence priority
process. The directive created a process that is much more dynamic and better able to keep
pace with the demands placed on the Intelligence Community (1C). The new process is called
the National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF) and contains a matriX which links
intelligence issues to specific geographic targets or organizations.

(U//FOUO) The Assistant Director for Central Intelligence for Analysis and Production (ADCI/AP),
Mark Lowenthal, will be responsible for implementing this new process, and to facilitate the
transition within SID, Mark Roth from that office, will be briefing the new process in Friedman
Auditorium on 23 April from 0830—1000. We invite all US citizens to attend and hear first—hand
how this new requirements process will be implemented across the IC. Specific items to be
covered in the briefing include but are not limited to the evolution of the priority process, an
explanation of NIPF, the transition from the old PDD—35 process, and the impact on NSA and the
entire intelligence community as we move to a more flexible, Intelligence Needs (IN) driven
system.

(U//FOUO) Following Mark's presentation, a Q & A session with * (NSA representative

to NIAPB and NICB), NSA representative to NIPF wor ing group,
, Chief Customer Gateway, Acting Chief of Requirements Analysis
Center, Chief of Information Needs Division, and —, Acting Chairman of

the SIGINT Requirements and Evaluations Sub—Committee (SIRVES), will be held.

(U//FOUO) The ro||out of NIPF is an important time for the 1C. This new process is a synthesis of
methods used in the past and will go a long way towards helping the Community address the
increasing and ever changing demands placed upon it. Please plan to attend this important
session to learn about changes in the community priorities system and their impact on NSA!
