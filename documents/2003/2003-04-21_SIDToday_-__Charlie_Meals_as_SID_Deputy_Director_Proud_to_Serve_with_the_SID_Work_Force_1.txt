FROM: Charlie Meals
Signals Intelligence Deputy Director
Run Date: 04/21/2003

(U//FOUO) It is indeed an honor to be selected as the new Deputy Director of the Signals
Intelligence Directorate. I am looking forward to working with MG Quirk and the entire SID work
force in my new role——exciting times lie ahead!

(U//FOUO) MG Quirk brings a wealth of experience that will benefit all of us in SID greatly. We
will work as a team and will communicate with the work force often and openly, looking to you
to help us as we continue to provide warfighters and policy makers with the vital information
they need to protect the nation. I have no doubt that the outstanding support you have most
recently provided during Operation Iraqi Freedom will continue as we work to meet our
customers' most important information needs.

(U//FOUO) I have always taken on new assignments with enthusiasm and optimism——this one is
no different. I believe we can have fun while working hard. MG Quirk and I will work to ensure a
smooth transition and minimize distractions as we bring together a new leadership team in SID.
We are here to serve the work force and provide a supportive environment that enables each of
you to concentrate on the issues that matter most to the Agency and to the nation.

Very Best Regards,
Charlie
