(U//FOUO) This weekend, Major General Quirk accompanied DIRNSA to the Palliser Conference,
held 23-24 June in Calgary, Canada. The Palliser conference is an annual meeting of the heads
of the 5-eyes SIGINT and HUMINT agencies. The conference also often includes law enforcement
agencies.
(U//FOUO) While the agenda for the conference was full of interesting topics of discussion,
including Operation Iraqi Freedom, Counterterrorism, North Korea, and the PRC, the main goal
of General Quirk's visit, as the new SIGINT Director, was to work on building the relationship
between NSA and the CSE, our Canadian counterparts.
