success, failure, and mediocrity. I encourage everyone to enjoy,
relax, and celebrate! Ourjobs are hard but we must appreciate,
respect, and celebrate each other and our successes. We want an
atmosphere that promotes creative thinking and risk taking
together with responsibility and accountability. We also need the
wisdom to grow our future through responsible delegation of
authority throughout the entire workforce.

(U//FOUO) Finally, I truly appreciate the warm welcome and
outstanding support I've already received during my short tenure
in CRD. I'm really looking forward to the exciting times ahead and
to working with each of you to produce the SIGINT successes that
will help ensure our nation's security, freedoms, and way of life.
