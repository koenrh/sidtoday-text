(U//FOUO) In 1971, a small group of energetic individuals founded
the International Affairs Institute (IAI) with the intent of presenting
to the NSA populace a variety of distinguished speakers from the
fields of business, politics, the military, and academia. Their aim
was to promote an interest in international events and affairs while
providing unique insights into those issues. That mission continues
today, as the IAI routinely hosts speakers from classified and
unclassified arenas to lecture on hot topics in international affairs
and encourages its members to write and publish papers on related
subjects.
(U//FOUO) The IAI employs many methods of raising awareness of
international affairs. These include annual events such as the
International Challenge, which tests members and non-members
on their international affairs trivia, a book sale featuring the latest
and greatest in international affairs literature, and an essay contest
covering a range of subjects. All of these endeavors are well
received by employees and many also include cash prizes for the
winners!

(U//FOUO) The organization is also extremely well connected to
the IA (Intelligence Analysis) Intern program. An intern sits on the
IAI Board, and the organization has recently instituted a new policy
granting membership to all IA Intern new-hires, free of charge for
their first year. This recruitment tool has been very successful, and
has prompted IAI to reach out to the other skill-field communities
with a similar membership agreement offer.
(U//FOUO) The International Affairs Institute has been reaching
out to the workforce for over 30 years, hosting hundreds of
speakers and lectures and publishing numerous papers on
international issues. We welcome new members as we look forward
to the next 30 years! For more information on this organization,
