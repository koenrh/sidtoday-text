certificate revocation. However, prior discussions recognized this problem and the subsequent
impracticality of multiple revocations throughout the agency. It was consequently decided that
existing, valid PKI certificates which would encounter this condition would not be revoked, but

identity validation would then occur at renewal time, ultimately bringing everything in line and
eliminating the need for numerous immediate reapplications in the meantime.
