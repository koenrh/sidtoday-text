%\ I W (U) Welcome to SIDtoday

Run Dates: 03/31/2003 , 04/01/2003

  

(U//FOUO) So what is this new SID Today page all about? The idea is to bring together
communications from across the SIGINT Directorate in a single webpage. This should provide a
good picture of what's going on in SID, and enable easy access. Let's go on a quick tour

(U//FOUO) First, at the top of the page are your links to the SID Homepage and NSA Daily.
Next, you will notice a big article on the left side of the page. This is the lead message, which
will change daily. It may consist of notes from management {the format of the former Messages
of the Day} orjust general information of interest. To the right of this, there is space for one or
two other articles {such as this one}, allowing the flexibility to present a variety of information.

(U//FOUO) Links to Latest News items, such as SID—all messages, can be found on the far right
side of the page in the black box. Elsewhere on the page are links to:

o SID Notes/Reports

o Calendars
o Workforce Outreach programs {such as Mo's Mailbag and What's on Your Mind} and
0 information on the Iraq Campaign and Campaign Against Terrorism.

You will also see links to SID Today archives and our feedback page.

(U//FOUO) We owe many, many thanks to the folks in Multimedia Solutions for putting this
together for us! Please take some time to explore the new page and use the feedback button to
let us know of any suggestions you may have—— we'll continue to grow over the coming weeks
and months. Tell us what you'd like to see here. If you have an article you'd like to run, send it
to S02C7all and we'll take it from there.
