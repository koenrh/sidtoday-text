(U//FOUO) NSA's Records Management experts report that though

Agency's four Records Disposition Schedules can help with this, as 4 _

legally maintained. With long—term or permanent electronic W
records, you must keep in mind that the hardware and software COMINT‘?

(U//FOUO) Even with short—term records, be sure to identify and
indeX records for easy retrieval. If you have the only copy of a
record, you may want to have a central directory for your office, or
be sure to arrange transfer of your records if you leave that

burying your valuable information and wasting a great deal of time
in searching and re—creating records. Also be sure to include
related information (metadata) with your electronic records.

records management software applications, as well as additional
