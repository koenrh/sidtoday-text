(TS//SI//OC/REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR and NZL) SID'S Counterintelligence and HUMINT
support (CIHS) Product Line was recently instrumental in the identification and subsequent
apprehension of "The King of Diamonds" from the CENTCOM deck of cards representing their list
of most—wanted Iraqis. Aziz Salih Al—Numan—— who as the King of Diamonds was number eight on
the list—— served as the Ba'ath Party Regional Command Chairman responsible for West
Baghdad.

(TS//SI//OC/REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR and NZL) SID's involvement began when U.S. Army
representatives contacted NSA to request time—sensitive SIGINT support to aid their planned
apprehension of Al—Numan. Following coordination with the Middle East North Africa Product Line,
CIHS surged to 24—hr operations on 20 May. CIHS also coordinated with the GEOCELL to ensure
that tippers would be distributed related to the target communications. When the summary of
contacts was delivered to the Army, officials requested that CENTCOM issue a final authorization
to seize Al—Numan. CIHS followed the tip—off with a limited distribution report the neXt morning.
Within 25 hours of the initial contact by the Army, Aziz Salih Al—Numan was apprehended, and
Army sources phoned in their appreciation for CIHS's quick response to their request for time—
sensitive support.

(U) According to press reports, Al—Numan ordered the destruction of Shi'a holy sites while
Governor of Karbala' and of An Najaf from 1977—1986. He also served as governor of occupied
Kuwait from November 1990—February 1991, where he enforced the policy of "reintegrating
Iraq's 19th province." Well done to all involved in his capture!
