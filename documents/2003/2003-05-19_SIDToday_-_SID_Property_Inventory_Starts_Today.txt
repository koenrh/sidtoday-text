(U//FOUO) SID Property Inventory Starts Today
FROM:
Chief, SIGINT Support Services
Run Date: 05/19/2003

(U//FOUO) The SID 2003 Property Inventory is set to begin today, 19 May. It may seem that we
just completed an inventory... and you would be correct: the 2002 inventory was completed on
6 March 2003 as the result of an extension. The results of that inventory were that only 97% of
the equipment was located, or another way to say it was that more then $27M of SID equipment
was "unaccounted for". The final report for the 2002 inventory has not been signed by the DIR
C/S.
(U//FOUO) The requirement for Property Accountability is outlined in US law, DOD accounting
manuals, NSA/CSS Directives and Regulations. NSA performs inventories for numerous reasons,
the first to ensure we can account for the equipment we should have on hand to apply against
mission requirements. Another reason is it's the law and we're trying to keep people out of jail.
The regulations require that all equipment with an acquisition cost of $5000 or more (as of July
2001) and all computers, regardless of cost to include laptops, palmtops/PDAs, etc. be
accounted for. The entire SID Property Accountability program includes data base management,
tagging new equipment, tracking equipment transfers, monitoring the shipping of property and
assisting in the turn-in or excessing of equipment. Also included laptop/palmtop inventories,
development of Property Policy and assisting in training Property Officers.
(U//FOUO) We hope the 2003 inventory will be easier, shorter and will achieve better results.
The objective is accounting for 100% of the equipment and we must finish by 31 December
2003. We hope that with support from senior SID leadership coupled with buy-in and support at
all levels of SID, that this inventory will be more successful, less painful and achieve better
results. It will require management awareness and commitment to make it happen. To reach our
goal we will need the support of everyone in SID. We hope to get some of the gaps in Property
Officers filled, train them and support them in performing their duties. As the inventory
progresses we will use tools such as this to communicate how inventory is going. We need to
achieve 100% accountability.
(U//FOUO) If you're interested in knowing more about Property Accountability we suggest you
