(U//FOUO) A new version of the customer feedback form will become operational on Tuesday,
10 June. This new form is designed to make data entry by analysts easier while focusing in on
key questions that SID believes are critical to a better feedback process.

(U//FOUO) The new form reduces the number of questions from more than 10 to just 3 â€” an
assessment of product value, product usage, and customer comments. The new form also allows
for entry of feedback for more than one SIGINT product at a time. It is available on the NSA web
at "go sigintfeedback" for proxy entry by NSA personnel and a version on INTELINK for direct
entry by customers will be available soon.

(U//FOUO) The redesign is the work of a Feedback Tiger Team, commissioned by the SID
Director last fall and consisting of representatives from the Directorate for Customer
Relationships and the Directorate for Analysis and Production. The Tiger Team focused on
identifying key impediments to effective customer feedback and developed the requirements for
this new form. This is only the first version of the new form. A future version on NSA net,
scheduled for release later this year, will add interaction with the PLUS database to facilitate
even easier processes.

(U//FOUO) Even with this small step, the critical element in the entire feedback process is to
have all meaningful customer feedback documented and entered in our feedback database.
Approximately 5% of all product currently has documented feedback, but this is only a fraction
of the feedback that NSA'ers have gathered in their regular encounters with customers. The neXt
goal of the Tiger Team will be to convince every analyst of the importance of his effort and their
role in its success. Look for more information on this effort in the near future.
