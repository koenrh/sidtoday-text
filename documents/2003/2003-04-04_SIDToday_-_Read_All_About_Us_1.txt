(U//FOUO) And now on a lighter note... As the weekend approaches, we thought we'd pass on
some "little—known" facts about NSA, taken from actual foreign press items:

"In the direction of the Baltic Sea [as published] and several miles from Washington, D.C.,..

...in the United States, there is a military installation—like, unapproachable area called "Fort
Meade," and they say that this area is not even indicated on maps and not many people are
actually interested in it."

Interview with Tomislav Kresovic, political analyst for the Belgrade—based Bina Agency: "Our
people idealize the role of the CIA to such an eXtent that they consider it to be the biggest and
best secret service in the world. However, I believe that the US National Security Agency (NSA)
is the most powerful espionage agency and that it rules the world at the moment, because it is
capable of achieving total surveillance of our planet and implementing a strategy of total
espionage."

"They did their work in silence, says the plaque dedicated to those who have fallen that greets
the few who succeed in entering Crypto City, the city of secrets. It consists of 60 buildings
surrounded by barbed wire and maple trees located between Washington and Baltimore. If,
instead of being ignored by all the maps, it were a real city, it would be the second largest in
Maryland. "Every day 38,000 employees, sworn not to reveal what they do even to their
children, park their cars around the two black buildings that hide two bunkers that are proofed
against any kind of interception. Inside work spies who have such abstruse titles as 'in charge of
anonymity,‘ or who produce newsletters with a warning under the letterhead: 'Destroy after
reading.‘ "
