(U//FOUO) ConSIDer This: What Does It Mean to Downgrade
COMINT?
FROM: SIGINT Communications

(C//SI) Downgrading is often confused with sanitization:
Sanitization is carried out in order to make COMINT information releasable outside of
COMINT channels (e.g., making it straight SECRET).
Downgrading, by contrast, does not involve taking material out of COMINT channels -the information stays either within or outside of COMINT channels, and that aspect of it
does not change. The only change is to the classification level. So, for example, changing
text from TS//SI to S//SI would be a downgrade, as would changing TOP SECRET
information to SECRET. In order to downgrade COMINT, a plausible cover (i.e., collection
from a less sensitive source) must exist.
(U//FOUO) The downgrading of U.S. COMINT is performed only by:
an Original Classification Authority (OCA) at NSA, in coordination with the Information
Security Policy office (DC322), or
personnel tasked specifically with the formal review and declassification of cryptologic
materials. (These are typically contractors working to comply with E.O. 12958, and does
not include anyone in the SIGINT Directorate below the level of OCA.)
