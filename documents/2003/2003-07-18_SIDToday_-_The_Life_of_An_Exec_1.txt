(U) The Life of An Exec

a

(U//FOUO) "Life, as we know it, will cease to exist if I don't see MG
Quirk immediately." As MG Quirk's executive assistant, this is one
of the many dramatic opening lines that I've heard. An exec is a
senior leader's front door, traffic cop, information manager, and
most importantly, conscience. Like triage in an emergency room,
an exec's main task is prioritization. Which of the hundreds of
incoming daily e—mails and documents are truly important? Out of
the dozens of requests, whom should they meet with today? What
do they have to sign now so the Earth does not spin off its axis? An
exec must make hundreds of decisions every day to optimize the
senior's time. The worst decision is no decision. Without an
effective filter, the senior is doomed to drown in information
overload and unending meetings.

(U//FOUO) What is a "typical" day in the life of an exec? Opening
the office before the craziness begins is critical as the exec must
skim new incoming information and tee up the hot issues of the
day. Then the daily roller coaster ride begins. The exec will attend
many of the back—to—back—to—back meetings—— look for the slightly
haggard individual sitting in the back row documenting actions or
going through volumes of paperwork. The exec must be prepared
to steal quality time with the senior between meetings or in transit
to provide updates or background on upcoming events. The churn
of activity usually continues through the late afternoon or early
evening. The end of the day is often the only available time to
work off actions and complete paperwork.

(U//FOUO) Keeping pace with a frenetic schedule is only skimming
the surface of being an exec. An exec is a confidant who works
significant and sensitive issues behind the scenes. They are the
senior's staunchest ally to the outside world but privately their
toughest critic providing candid assessments of decisions,
meetings, and briefings. The exec represents the senior at all times
and must build positive relationships across the organization,
particularly with the staffs of other senior leaders. An exec makes
sure promises are kept and questions are answered. An exec is the
voice inside the senior's head reminding them of their priorities and
obligations.

(U//FOUO) So the hours are long and the pace is relentless—— why
would anyone want to do this? Immersion into this job provides

one of the purest training experiences. An exec has a front row seat

to the good, the bad, and the ugly of the senior leadership lifestyle.
Most execs serve for a limited duration (12 to 24 months is
typical)—— long enough to learn the job and be effective, but short
enough to maintain sanity. Whether they aspire to be a senior or
just more effective at their current level, executive assistants
return to the workforce with a much—improved understanding of
the implications of their work as part of the big picture.
