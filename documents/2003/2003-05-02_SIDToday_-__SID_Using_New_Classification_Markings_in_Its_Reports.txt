(U//FOUO) SID Using New Classification Markings in Its Reports

(U//FOUO) Last week, SID reporters were given the go-ahead to start using the "new"
Intelligence Community classification markings in the free-flow body of their serialized reports.
(U//FOUO) As a result, the codewords UMBRA, SPOKE, MORAY, and ZARF are being phased out
of the text section of SIGINT reports. This means, for example, that paragraphs formerly portion
marked TSC (TOP SECRET UMBRA) will become TS//SI (TOP SECRET//COMINT), and SC
(SECRET SPOKE) will become S//SI (SECRET//COMINT).
(U//FOUO) By way of background, the "new" IC markings were instituted by the National SIGINT
Committee in October 1999. However, use of the new markings required extensive changes to
the HIGHTIDE software used to issue reports. On 25 April of this year, most of the software
modifications were completed to allow the new markings to appear in the "manually-generated"
parts of a report, i.e. the text. The machine-generated overall classification line will continue to
show the "old" markings until the system is fully modernized, however. SID's Reporting Policy
and Guidance office has issued a memo authorizing and explaining the use of the new markings-click here for further details.
