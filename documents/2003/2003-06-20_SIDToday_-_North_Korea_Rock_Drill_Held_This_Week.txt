(S//SI) North Korea Rock Drill Held This Week
FROM: the North Korean Issue Management Team
Unknown
Run Date: 06/20/2003

(S//SI) This week, from 16-17 June, the North Korean (NK) Issue Management Team (IMT)
conducted the first in a series of NK Rock Drills. This effort is in keeping with the Director's
charge to build on best practices/lessons learned from Iraq-- with a focus on preparing the
cryptologic system to support policymakers and warfighters. Subject matter experts were
assembled from across the cryptologic community to assess the NSA/CSS posture against North
Korea. Over 80 representatives from 31 NSA/CSS organizations across the Enterprise attended
the two-day session. The Rock Drill consisted of a series of information briefs and small-group
discussions. Numerous issues and gaps concerning our current capabilities were identified, and
the results are posted on the North Korean IMT web page (or type "go nk").
(S//SI) The first day's session commenced with opening remarks by SID Director MG Quirk, then
launched into a series of briefs from each of 15 presenting organizations, starting with the
NSAW Directorates, SUSLAK (Senior U.S. Liaison Advisor-Korea), moving through the SID
Deputy Directorates, MSOC (Misawa Security Operations Center), Kunia RSOC and the CSS/SCE
components, and ending with a discussion of the military OPLANS for Korea (complete agenda
and briefing slides are posted on the "go nk" web site). On the second day, small group
discussions, facilitated by OPSIGINT, identified key issues and gaps raised during the first day.
The small groups focused on Access, Collection, Production and Dissemination/Interoperability
topic areas and captured/prioritized the essential 3-5 gaps in each area. The large group
reassembled after a break to review the reports from each topic area. The slides from these
briefs are posted on the "go nk" web at the TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL level.
(S//SI) While Rock Drill-1 was limited to the NSA/CSS community and focused on our current
posture, future Rock Drills will include Second Parties, SIGINT and Information Assurance
customers as well as other Intelligence Community members. Rock Drill-2 will be hosted by MG
Quirk and is scheduled for 5 August 0800-1100, Room 9A135 (date changed from 23 July).
Participants will be at the senior level, in contrast to the working-level nature of Rock Drill-1.
During Rock Drill-2 the IMT will review the progress of the NK Multi-INT Review; provide an
analysis of NK Priority-2 Information Needs (which represent 70% of total INs); and present an
overview of Rock Drill-1 which will focus on addressing the NK issues and gaps agreed upon in
Rock Drill-1, as well as recommend a "way-ahead" in resolving these challenges.
(S//SI) Aside from discussing important NK issues, Rock Drill-1 afforded the opportunity for
visitors from CONUS and OCONUS to interact with NSAW Korean hands by building new
relationships or renewing old acquaintances. While the evaluation forms collected have yet to be
reviewed, it is the general consensus that Rock Drill-1 was a success and participants look
forward to playing in future Korea Rock Drills!
