(U//FOUO) In the recent article "Letter From Ottawa" it was noted that Ottawans enjoy
gnawing on beaver tails, but we neglected to explain what that means. The author,
, has cleared up this mystery:

   

(U) "Beaver tail is indeed a pastry: dough rolled into a plate—sized oblong and deep fat fried and
then covered in cinnamon sugar, or jam, or maple syrup, or whatever you fancy (they also do
savory versions). Very warming on a cold winter day (but not recommended for those on a low—
carb diet)!!"
