§\ I W (U//FOU0) SID Leadership Offsite: Believing in Magic

FROM: Charles Berlin
SID Chief of Staff
Run Date: 05/27/2003

      

(U//FOUO) "I believe in magic," stated MG Quirk last week, setting the tone for the new Signal
Intelligence Directorate (SID) leadership team's first group meeting. There is an almost entirely
new ensemble at the upper echelon of the SID, and they are new not only to the workforce, but
to each other——at least in the roles they now occupy. Energy was high as the individuals got to
know one another, began to form as a unified team, and addressed the business of SID.

(U//FOUO) SID leadership wants to create an atmosphere where magic can happen by
harnessing the power of SID's greatest asset: its workforce. Led by SID Director MG Richard
Quirk and Deputy Director Charlie Meals, the newly—appointed Deputy Directors

Jim Allen, and , their Assistant Deputy Directors, Technical Directors, and other
SID leaders discussed how to "facilitate brilliance" by eliminating impediments in the way of
accomplishing SID's mission. All agreed that leadership's primary responsibility is to empower
and engage the workforce and push decision—making down to the right levels. As MG Quirk
stated, "We need to start and end our decision—making process with what's best for the nation."

(U//FOUO) The leaders considered where SID is today and its future direction. The leadership
team agreed that a sound strategy and organizational structure is already in place and
delivering incredible results. As the new leadership team coalesces, their emphasis will be on
evolution, not revolution. The leadership team will build upon this initial meeting and continue
the steps they have taken toward building a responsive leadership team delivering consistent,
fair, and understandable guidance.

(U//FOUO) Two more leadership meetings are planned for the coming months. The leadership
team is united in their enthusiasm for the SIGINT mission and overcoming the challenges that
lie ahead. Let the magic begin!
