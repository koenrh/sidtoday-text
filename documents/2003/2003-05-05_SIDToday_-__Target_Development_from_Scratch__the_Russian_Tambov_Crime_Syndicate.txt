(TS//SI) Target Development from Scratch: the Russian Tambov
Crime Syndicate

(TS//SI) How to attack a new intelligence target? Last year, the State Department submitted an
Intelligence Need for SIGINT on the leader of the Russian Tambov crime syndicate, a Mr.
Kumarin. (State wanted to learn whether there were any links between the St. Petersburg
syndicate and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had been Deputy Mayor of St. Petersburg in
the mid 1990's.) To produce SIGINT on this topic, SID analysts had their work cut out for them-NSA had neither Mr. Kumarin's phone number nor a sample of his voice.
(TS//SI) Many months of target development, however, have led to success: the Office of Crime
and Narcotics (OCN) is now issuing SIGINT reports based on intercept of Kumarin's telephone.
The identification and collection of Kumarin's phone number was made possible by the efforts of
OCN's 
 who worked with Math Research Group analysts to produce contact
chaining charts and collection managers to optimize collection. This task could be accomplished
only through the coordinated efforts of various SIGINT disciplines. By taking this corporate
approach, we not only acquired Kumarin's phone number, but also gained more insights into his
organization and activities.
