(C) The Matrix is Here...Original NIPF Version, Not "Reloaded"
FROM:
NSA Representative to NIPF Working Group
Run Date: 05/15/2003

(C) In late April, you were told that NIPF was coming, and now that statement has become
reality. To refresh you, NIPF is the new National Intelligence Priorities Framework, which
completely overhauls the intelligence priority process. NIPF is the response to a Presidential
Directive and is a more dynamic process than ones in the past. It includes a priorities review
every six months and comprises a basic matrix --a prioritized list of intelligence topics that
encompass the breadth of the Intelligence Community missions plotted against a global set of
target countries and organizations.
(C) The NIPF matrix has been approved by the DDCI for Community Management, Joan
Dempsey, and the ADCI for Analysis and Production, Mark Lowenthal for community release. The
NIPF matrix, together with the DCI priorities defined in NSPD-26, will be posted on the new
ADCI/AP NIPF website on Intelink. Information on specific Intelink websites on which NIPF and
NSPD-26 data are posted is listed below. In addition, the files and documents may be accessed
on the Strategic Intelligence Issues website ("go S17")
(C) The Intelink version is available at
