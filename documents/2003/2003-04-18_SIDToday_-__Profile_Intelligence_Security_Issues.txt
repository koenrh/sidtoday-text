(S//SI) You're at home reading the Sunday paper when you come
across something you think is classified. "Is this a Cryptologic
Insecurity? What is a Cryptologic Insecurity?"

(S//SI) A Cryptologic Insecurity (CI) is when intelligence is
disclosed--such as via a media leak--without authorization. SID has
an office that handles its CI Program: the Intelligence Security
Issues office. Every day we scan approximately 350 press items for
potential CIs. We then research databases to confirm or deny the
validity of the CI. This is a vital step in the CI analysis process to
determine whether or not to forward the package to NSA's Public
Affairs Office (PAO) for tasking. What about SIGINT losses? We
review books and Internet articles to discover and document these
losses.

(S//SI) Intelligence Security Issues also maintains the FIRSTFRUIT
Foreign Knowledge Database, which currently contains over 5,000
insecurity-related records. This is a SIGINT database that is the
Intelligence Community's prototype. FIRSTFRUIT combines all
SIGINT-related information--Espionage Damage Assessments,
Cryptologic Insecurities (Media/Books, etc.), Unauthorized
Disclosures, Demarches, and Liaison exchanges--into one
database.
(U//FOUO) We also are responsible for the SIGINT Director's staff
portion of the NSA Countering Adversary Denial and Deception
(D&D;) Program, proactively protecting U.S. intelligence sources
and methods and determining ways to counter foreign denial and
deception. Our findings are published in D&D; assessments and
respond to D&D; questions from the Intelligence Community.
Finally, Intelligence Security Issues manages SID's Operations
Security (OPSEC) Program. We meet with SID OPSEC coordinators
to review the program and provide OPSEC training and guidance;
monitor the conduct of OPSEC within the SIGINT Directorate; and
submit appropriate NSA-required OPSEC reports.
(U//FOUO) This is just a brief overview of what Intelligence
Security Issues does every day. For more detailed information
